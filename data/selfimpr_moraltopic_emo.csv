366750,i honestly dont think anything is the matter with you no one needs to know how you think or your thought patterns and tbh i get the feeling that you are most likely a really good person it would seem that the way you view being a good person is only going to make you a better person like whats the matter with constantly judging yourself against others and wanting to be a better and better person,1.0,1,2.6,0
363814,people thought of me as that girl and i also had the same problems you have at least some of them and i am absolutely not that person anymore the good isnt as good as it was but the bad also isnt that bad op should learn that people change through life and nothing stays the same,1.0,1,3.51,3.51
356703,i second this also bad things happen to good people every day you dont need to intentionally fuck around and find out how bad being honeless is because you no call no showed at work just to exercise your freedom to say fuck it youve put a lot of hard work into your life to start shitting on itjust to feel different you want to have a better life find productive uses of your time and dont do shit that hurts you good luck,1.0,1,2.38,3.57
348241,everyone likes to do whats easiest its much easier to be a bad person in every way when thinking about how we can do something bad several ways come to mind but to do good things usually not and when they do they are very complicated it needs to have a very strong motive a driving force she is the one who will make you dedicate yourself to the difficult things,1.0,1,1.41,2.82
344273,i would say you are not a bad person unless you purposely dont do good things and prefer to do bad things if you make mistakes while doing something it doesnt make you a bad person just keep trying to do better the next time since you are reaching out here it makes me feel like you dont want to be a bad person when you are going to do anything stop and think if it going to be good or bad always choose good choices while you are reaching out and trying to be a better person reach out to jesus he has all the right answers and can guide you to a better life he definitely did that for me,1.0,1,2.46,4.1
344002,what is your definition of a bad person i think im a bad person because i dont do enough productive things or have friends other commenter thinks youre trying to excuse being a dick to people how i deal with this is i try not to think about it i am not the arbiter of anyones worth myself included i can do good things and that isnt going to suddenly make it better if i rob somebody conversely the bad things i do dont negate the good things also change is inevitable it might not happen as much or as quickly as youd like but its always happening do you care about the same things year old you cared about no right you changed,1.0,1,1.61,2.42
342622,if you were evil you wouldnt see anything wrong with your behavior the fact that you realize what youre saying is hateful and wrong is proof that you arent bad your best bet is probably to find better friends so you dont need to say stuff you dont mean to fit in,1.0,1,0,3.85
251642,its okay to be good and trying to be good but realize youre human too and humans are not perfect also be careful not weaken your character i dont know what your exactly mean by always doing the right thing but often people who think they are good are just weak they always put others above themselves never say no always be nice to others etc,1.0,1,4.55,0
341707,depends on what being a bad guy means if by being bad you mean lying cheating stealing mooching etc then yes its really that bad if by being bad you mean living for yourself thinking for yourself producing for yourself and pursuing your own happiness then no its the opposite of bad its good its being selfless or what people sometimes mean by kind or nice thats bad,1.0,1,2.94,8.82
336909,you are a brave person you know that carritt in fact im rather impressed with what i read today from you not a lot of people have the balls and courage to admit they are terrible people and if you want my opinion realizing you are a bad person is one of the first steps to improving yourself i look around and i see people who justify bad actions drive cars like suicidal maniacs justify insults and bullying but not you at least you admit youve done wrong which in my opinion sets you far apart from the wretched people who think everything they do is correct pat yourself on the back carritt,1.0,1,0.88,4.42
332042,yes because you have an over inflated idea of what it means to be a good person a good person is someone who is capable of bad yet restrains themselves a pacifist is not a good person because they dont fight a trained fighter who turns the other cheek is a good person good people dont deluded themselves good people know their flaws so deeply they strive to be better despite them if youve failed the only test youve ever taken are you a good student,1.0,1,8.14,1.16
329175,i really appreciate that perspective so thank you but i cant help but feel that if i really was good like you say that id feel good but i dont really feel like a good person im constantly agonizing about my own morality and asking if i did the right thing but i dont know i imagine a good person wouldnt have to think this hard about if theyre good or not they would just know if that makes sense,1.0,1,7.5,1.25
304377,this is like a network and its cartoon you can tell what network is a good or bad network whether the cartoon is good or bad a good network has good cartoons and a bad network has bad cartoons what is produced is by what network its coming from good minds produce good cartoons and the same is with action good actions come from good hearts a parent wouldnt look to give their kid food and water a place you sleep and a school to learn but to value their kid more than they to love so that their eyes are turned to the needs and they will get fulfilled because they are valued one is a burden and one is an expression,1.0,1,7.32,3.25
298692,there is no such thing as a bad person everyone is just a product of their own environment as far as improving as a person after raping someone you can pretty much only become a better person from here take things one day at a time and dont let that keep you from chasing your dreams,1.0,1,0,1.79
290263,i guarantee your issue is your personality i agree youre probably not a good person i disagree its possible to have good intentions but for whatever reason s the impact doesnt match intent so in either case yes until you improve yourself your life is gonna suck and also its possible to realize that you were kind of an asshole but you choose to change your thoughts and actions become your ideas and habits and that ultimately can and does affect your personality after a length of time but its painful as birth which makes sense because youre kind of re birthing yourself,1.0,1,1.94,0.97
285114,youre not a bad person it is good to spend a few minutes throughout the day to reflect on what you appreciate about people you come in contact with its sort of hard at first for some people but over time it will be easier if you stick with it you will have a more positive bias towards people,1.0,1,3.39,1.69
276955,this post has reaffirmed that good people do exist i had lost all hope and faith because the way the people treated me for following ethical path honesty and trusting other people for their word it resulted in jealousy back stabbing and deceitful attitude but i will continue on the path i am on thanks for this post,1.0,1,3.45,1.72
272864,you mention that many people go far by being manipulators while that may be the case the chances of living a good life are far better if youre genuinely a good person you second point was about business again as someone who studies entrepreneurship and who has a bit of experience in that field as well i can tell you that being good goes a long way im not saying that you should be weak and be someone with no backbone not at all being strong and understanding evil are important theres a reason ive read the laws of power and try to be careful and vigilant around people there are a lot of shitty people in the world however my point stands that being a genuinely good person is good advice and will get you further in life in most cases at least in todays western society if you are good as you say understanding evil is important because it allows you to stay smart i dont disagree with this everything is nuance being good is great as a default state but being flexible and prepared for the worst case scenarios are also important whats wrong with me saying that we should be kind i think youre taking my words as an extreme just because i say be kind doesnt mean im saying be kind all the time to everyone circumstances are unique and you will need to be able to adapt to situations whats the book youre referring to about the soul needing to be neutral im curious,1.0,1,2.69,0
264229,you admit you are the problem and i like how you acknowledging that you want to do better next time for your sake for others and now you are distinguishing right wrongs you wanting to share this i see that you just showed me a human side of yourself right there no you are not a bad person or not human at all like you think you are,1.0,1,0,1.47
259856,there are no bad ones because there arent any im years old i still live with my parents im obese and i havent had any kind of relationship since i was the world isnt going to allow anything all i can do is work to improve my situation with the hope that ill improve my luck someday but its not like im going all in on the hope that itll actually make a difference,1.0,1,2.7,1.35
405946,wtf even is a bad person i mean really there is nothing that is wholly good or bad everyone i mean every single human makes mistakes and has traits they do not like about themselves these are part of what makes us human not accepting that you will make mistakes is to argue against being something other than human,1.0,1,1.69,5.08
409542,admitting how much i make excuses and get in my own way learning to catch myself in the moment before choosing harmful words or actions realizing that people will be people no ones perfect including me people will make mistakes and hurt each other but that doesnt mean they are a terrible person,1.0,1,0,3.77
413873,bad ppl are the ones who dont feel remorse or guilt or even try to take accountability for the things theyve done every grown person can go on about all the things theyve done we all do stupid shit some that weve picked up from our environment to blame and others that we just did on our own but you arent a bad person just making bad decisions coping with things the wrong way,1.0,1,0,6.76
415331,i think about that almost every day latelly found out the answer in a meme i saw this month good people sleeps well thinking everything is all right bad people sleeps knowing what is wrong and i complete this meme with my cents assertive people sleeps confortably knowing how to defeat the bad ones while keeping the good ones as friends,1.0,1,3.28,3.28
496866,the world is evil because evil is the essence of our nature everytime we have power we abuse it everytime we do something right we boast about it but everytime we are wrong we forget about it we are naturally lazy we are naturally violent we are selfish we are conquerors it is simply part of our nature not because there is not enough good people,1.0,1,1.52,1.52
496698,there are a lot of perfectly good people raised in a terribly problematic world theres no baseline of goodness because everyone is just busy trying to survive as long as greed and selfishness exist people will always struggle and often lose themselves were flawed and easily broken even the best of people can become monsters in a world like this one its sad,1.0,1,1.59,3.17
496676,i have a particular view of this i think that today evil is winning mainly due to the relativization of evil and good many opinions and few facts i dont think most of it is relative i think there is reality and there is what people think learning to see reality as it is and not affect it with your thoughts its something most people should learn since childhood,1.0,1,1.45,0
496675,i agree i guess i didnt word that very clearly lol evil exists just because you choose to view the world in a positive way doesnt mean evil or negative things arent happening im saying the world is a good place for the most part but if we turn on the news atleast in my country you would think the world is burning because negativity and fear and evil sells,1.0,1,1.43,1.43
496672,this is easy to define people use this question to show that evil depends on ones point of view when in fact thats not how reality works evil is nothing more than something that results in a bad long term future lets take hitler one of the most famous names as an example suppose we go back to the past when hitler was just a child would it be good to kill him so that he doesnt kill thousands in the future that would lead to a better long term future right wrong lets analyze the possibilities killing him means putting values of a good society as a variable since we could commit murders if the murdered person is bad we would create a future bathed in blood the second point is if we killed hitler he wouldnt serve as an example of how harmful a bad person who comes to power can be this would lead to a low social awareness that would lead to another bad person coming to power and committing atrocities again so hitler coming to power is a necessary evil because it makes people see how much is bad allowing this to prevent this from happening good people must create a system that prevents people like that from winning so we see that bad is what creates a bad long term society,1.0,1,1.32,3.08
496670,i understand that but how do you explain the majority of society that gets along with each other if evil was of the worlds feelings then we all would be committing crime and trying to destroy each other to say the world is good or bad is perception in reality the world is nebulous neither good nor bad and thats proven in your example of good to evil during birth,1.0,1,4.29,2.86
496667,lets analyze in reality people are born inherently good after all what kind of person would want to cause harm to make the world in which they live worse and this can also be analyzed metaphorically making a parallel with reality if light is the representation of goodness as it generates life darkness would be the representation of evil as it generates death if people are born it means that godness already has an inherent advantage what happens is the confusion of good with bad evil people try to justify their actions covering their faces for the truth and denying responsibility the world becomes bad when there are many bad people living in it but no matter how many bad people there are good will always be present and will be the only way to progress in bad there is no progress so we conclude that the world is only bad because there are not enough good people people become bad because they end up accepting evil as truth in their lives so every decision made is towards him to the point that good ends up becoming a childish naive illusion for example telling a harmless lie thinking it will lead to a better result when in fact only the truth can lead to the better inherent result,1.0,1,2.29,3.67
495588,written by saint kabir das i searched for the crooked met not a single one when searched myself i found the crooked one translation i went on the search for the bad guy bad guy i couldnt find when i searched my mind non one is nastier then me meaning this doha is about observing ones own mind kabir says that he searched the world for the bad guy the real evil person but he couldnt find the evil person no matter where he looked then he looked within at his own thinking process his own mind the he found the real evil person who lived in his mind unchecked when we accuse condemn another it is our mind that is doing the finger pointing the other person is probably innocent or the victim of his circumstances were we to inhabit the condemned persons body live his life have his conditioning then we too would behave and act the same,1.0,1,0,1.88
485116,i wish good to good people wishing good to bad people is currently out of my ability and moral viewpoint maybe i would add taking care of your health and well being as for that might depend on who you ask someone you just had an online argument with wont say the same as someone who cares for you,1.0,1,8.47,3.39
472265,your subjective world view doesnt create statistics of which you mentioned but i do understand that world is not a perfect place bad things happen all the time but still doesnt mean there is no good in it the world is not black and white even if it seems like it there is around billion humans and everyone has a perspective a window to look at all different stories filled with good and the bad,1.0,1,2.67,2.67
470528,if you ever wonder why bad things happen to good people its because god knows theyre capable of handling it dont worry my friend you will survive and thrive throught this with time my practical recommendation that i sincerely believe will help you is to develop yourself iternally to become a man of abundance in your inner world remake your life find your new objective in life that you have capability to achieve think about your life in a new perspective and with new light in your heart with hope and passion for something that make you alive even if you are in pain hope that helps stay strong and never give up,1.0,1,2.65,2.65
466450,i dont think im evil because i have done any harm to others or myself i think the sexual desire and attraction to the opposite gender i e women is evil now i cant exactly get rid of that completely can i the best i can do is bury it deep inside and make sure it doesnt try to get out back again,1.0,1,0,0
456867,people are only as moral as their actions people are born blank slates their choices determine their moral worth this is the thing you arent getting you you personally were born with the potential to become a jesus christ or a buddha ultimate moral good but you were also born with the potential to become a ted bundy or a hitler ultimate moral evil you still have that potential to this very day you could wake up tomorrow and decide to give all your wealth to a charity or you could wake up tomorrow and decide to do a horrible act you still have that ultimate potential you were born with just as everyone does as you grow older your runway is limited but potential is always infinite the fallacy most people fall into is to believe themselves incapable of evil people like to say i could never do what hitler did i could never do what ted bundy did i am incapable of that level of evil people say this to reassure themselves that they are good and others are evil but the truth is we all have that potential for evil within ourselves no one can ever truly say i am not capable of evil everyone is capable of ultimate good or evil to say you are not capable of evil also limits your perceived potential for good potential is omnidirectional and ultimate by nature,1.0,1,1.69,0
455034,the world is deeper than surface level if you believe in the battle of good vs evil it sounds like you were just put on the battlefield you chose the good side this happens everyday sometimes the choice is small sometimes its blatantly gross and evil be vigilant and stay strong you are a pure person of light dont ever let anyone or anything tell you otherwise,1.0,1,2.99,0
454029,i understand youre trying to find the most extreme examples possible to try to get me to say there are bad people but it just doesnt work like that there is logic in my theory and im not sure why it upsets you so much youre welcome to disagree with the theory its not that big of a deal,1.0,1,0,3.39
454021,so that isis leader that my unit spent months and lost men chasing down who would torture children rape woman commit massive genocide in ways that would make you piss your pants is just a person that decided to do bad things however he could have decided to change his ways and plant flowers for the rest of his life in some random country help neighbors help grandma at the grocery store but he wouldnt be considered a bad person there is no logic in your theory i honestly dont think you have seen true evil,1.0,1,0,3.13
453723,hitler wasnt born evil hitler was born with ultimate potential for either good or evil just like of the rest of us he made a series of choices which ultimately led evil choices and to horrific consequences his actions were evil perhaps he himself came to embody evil but he as a human cant inherently be evil every single human born into this world has the potential to become a hitler or to become a buddha we all have infinite potential in either direction the most dangerous thing you can convince yourself of is i am not capable of doing evil things we are all capable step by step micro decision by micro decision if you believe you simply dont have the potential or capacity to do evil things you are statistically more likely to end up doing evil things bc you can gradually and progressively justify your choices until you find yourself doing evil things if you think you arent capable of darkness you are more susceptible darkness will sneak up on you better defense only real defense against your darker nature is to come to know and understand your shadow self get uncomfortably familiar with what your shadow might be capable of given context and rationalization only this way can you identify pathways which will lead you to bad places and avoid even the appearance of evil by knowing that you hold ultimate potential within yourself and you consciously choose to do right action knowing you could if you wanted to choose anything else,1.0,1,0.39,1.17
441200,strengthen the good ones against the bad ones dont take it out on the good ones or the bad ones will grow and multiply and by bad i mean non consent type of bad and not the motorcycle sunglasses leather jacket kinda bad righteous men those who do that thing right despise wicked men and will usually even shoot them on sight if they can get away with it,1.0,1,2.9,8.7
439243,bro tbvh people are good as long as you dont know them deeply once you start a person knowing in a much deeper way youll realise that everyone is not good that is just how life is it is hard to differentiate people quickly but one tip watch out for people who for example initiate convo without wanting anything in return those can be somewhere good this was my personal advice peace out homie s,1.0,1,4,0
432734,i dont necessarily see the good in everyone but my default is kindness many say that people have to earn their respect i start with respect and then if people earn my disrespect so be it but i dont really do arguments if people are consistently toxic ill create some distance i dont follow sadhguru but i used to be into a lot of zen and read be here now by ram dass over and over and it helped sadhana is sadhana i dont buy into the spiritual side of it anymore but non attachment and being in the moment are potent tools for dealing with life and other people i no longer believe that everyone has good in them though ive seen too much,1.0,1,1.6,0.8
430255,i dont believe there are bad people there are only good and bad choices i think if you understand that first youll get the perspective you need to start moving forward then every time you make a bad choice youll see it as just that one bad choice instead of seeing it as confirmation that you are a bad person get a journal and write down your good choices each day try to beat the number each day any good choice counts do this for months and youll feel like a good person ive been seeing a therapist for years its great see a therapist,1.0,1,3.81,4.76
427748,can you point out where in his her post evil is being used as an argument to me it sounds like he she simply states that both virtues and vices exist and that living a life to him her is striking a balance between them nowhere calling either virtues or vices inherently good or bad but rather stating that it is the interpretation of the individual or the environment whatever we or our environment considers bad,1.0,1,1.32,3.95
426271,do you seriously believe that majority of people are good flawed yes but good at their heart most people are not inherently mean or bad we find in the world what we put out if you find only betrayal and pain consider what energy youre putting out am i lucky that i continually find good people around me no i find them because i allow them the grace to show it i understand feeling burned and anger is a powerfully addictive emotion ive been there but choosing to find the good in the world leads to actually finding it choosing to see the ugliness will only show you the worst of it,1.0,1,3.57,2.68
420934,dont feel bad for being a good person you gave them the benefit of the doubt and helped a person in need but i do want to say that your good nature will attract the wrong kind of people sometimes people that take advantage of kind people it sucks over time you will learn to trust your gut and be able to determine who is genuine and who is taking advantage dont stop being a good person but dont allow people to mistreat you either,1.0,1,3.53,1.18
420777,yes thats what i said being a good person doesnt exclude having boundaries and being firm in maintaining them it doesnt exclude fighting for what you want in life you can do all the things op described as being strong and be a good person except being cruel that is never necessary,1.0,1,3.85,1.92
257829,yeah thats fair appreciate the respect i think the thing that clashes with me is the fact that we deserve good i guess it comes from the idea that we are good and perfect i dont really think anyone is naturally good everyone has done bad stuff so how can they be good if i am not good then why should i expect good things to happen i guess the definition of good seems shaky to me too it seems a lofty goal to achieve wealth happiness and relationships what happens when those dont happen am i just bound to be sad forever,1.0,1,8.74,1.94
504747,the concept of good and bad is an interesting one you can do good or bad things but that doesnt need to define you as a person if youve been doing things that you consider bad and you dont want to do those things anymore make a list of things you consider good and start doing them i imagine you will then begin to feel like a good person,1.0,1,5.8,4.35
249961,there are lots of good genuine people in the world the kind worth time and effort your right pleasing man is not the way humans have a tendency to change as the wind blows just look at whats happening in our culture right now last week one thing was ok and now its taboo i suggest digging deep planting roots in the rock and see what happens with all the windy people in the world we all need deeply grounded roots to withstand the storms of life be blessed be well,1.0,1,2.2,0
211211,being a good person should first and foremost be to feel good yourself youre all the better for it you shouldnt be anything for an abstract other not saying you shouldnt change yourself for your loved ones but building yourself so that people like you isnt going to be a very satisfying endevaour,1.0,1,5.66,0
204974,being a good person so that others see you being good is a sham its not genuine and people can tell be a good person if you want to be good be good for goodness sake if you are worried about what being good will get you then you are doing it for the wrong reasons and will get the wrong results,1.0,1,9.68,1.61
204466,number is important you arent good or bad and it certainly isnt determined by what you do you are a combination of a human who does good things and does bad things but dont extend that to yourself as thats toxic its a shift in perspective so easily we want to think after doing a bunch of good things wow i really did do all those good things i suppose i am a good person after all that thinking is toxic and later it can apply to the bad wow i really did all those bad things i suppose i am a bad person after all a better perspective is this wow i really do both good and bad things but i am a person neither good nor bad i am fulfilling my part as a human by being alive and human i hope this helps anyone,1.0,1,5.44,4.76
201863,i started watching the show the good place half a year ago its really funny and casual but it had a weird impact on me it made me question if i was a good person ive always seen myself as good but now ive realized that was just arrogant and naive the last couple of months i have been studying moral philosophy and stuff like it and i can honestly say i have improved but i have also started realizing i am never going to be able to see myself as a good person but that doesnt matter its the honest trying that counts i think i dont really know but i hope so ive changed how i view life in such a short time i feel like i dont really know the guy i was six months ago he wasnt worse per se he just didnt see himself for what he was an idiot in a world of other idiots,1.0,1,3.73,0
192113,i believe that people are not inherently good but you can bring out good and positive behaviors by connecting with other people and reinforcing theirs with your own good vibes but you have to make the choice to extend the olive branch and you will have to keep on doing it many times as most people will keep rejecting it it can and will bruise your ego and pride over rejections so its just an internal decision you have to make and its not an easy one that never stops being hard,1.0,1,4.35,0
45753,if you look for the bad youll see it theres plenty of injustice pain and suffering if you look for the good youll see it theres plenty of love kindness and generosity what you look for is what youll see look for the good at times youll need to create it youve got this,1.0,1,5.56,5.56

45379,why be a good person its an interesting question at first glance the answer seems clear cut most of us want to be good because its part of what makes us who we are its almost like we were born with a mechanism that guides us morally some call that our soul some call that the orienting reflex some call that our conscience being good seems not only to be the right decision but also the most intelligent decision if we want to survive and thrive in a society then being a manipulating piece of garbage wont get us very far well have problems with the police well have problems with the law well have problems with the other members of our society one of the most primal instincts that we have as humans is the desire for belongingness and love theres a reason that abraham maslow has this desire as part of his hierarchy of needs how can one belong in a society and be loved by the people around them if they are not good being good is also helpful in business for those of us who live in the west capitalism and entrepreneurship are some of the values that our society holds dear the way entrepreneurship works is rather simple solve problems create solutions and provide value all of these components of entrepreneurship are in nature good of course not everyone who is successful in business is good there are a lot of shady and bad businesspeople with that being said providing value is at the crux of what makes someone a good entrepreneur we see already that being a good person feels good is helpful when it comes to business is helpful when it comes to people and is helpful when it comes to our overall health its almost like being good is both selfish and selfless heres a metaphor that has played an important role in my thinking your character and your integrity are like a glass of water the water is clean clear pure and transparent what happens if a drop of poison or a drop of blood falls into the glass one drop contaminates the entire water its for that reason that a small lie or a small bad deed is not always so small doing things that are wrong even if they may appear not to be a big deal slowly contaminate your entire character and your entire body of work i believe it was jordan peterson who first introduced me to this idea living a life of lying cheating and other bad deeds will eventually catch up to you everything comes out one day some like to call it karma some like to call it the legal system some like to call it heaven and hell i like to view it like this if were bad then were not only hurting the people around us but were also hurting ourselves where is the meaning in that it goes against every instinct that we have abraham maslow has self actualization at the top of his pyramid of needs how can one ever reach anything close to that if we are constantly doing things that are wrong its not possible heres a quote from philosopher and write fyodor dostoevsky that ive always liked above all dont lie to yourself the man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him or around him and so loses all respect for himself and for others and having no respect he ceases to love i believe this quote can be applied not only to lying but also to all other types of wrong deeds final thoughts being good is not easy there have been a lot of wars and suffering throughout history humans are quite malleable a bad childhood or bad genetics can lead people to become monsters there is a lot of evil in the world with that being said i believe humans are capable of a lot good being a moral and ethical person being good being kind and helping others will not only make the world a more beautiful place but it will also be good for ourselves it feels good its a meaningful process and it leads to continual self improvement why dirty your soul why dirty that clear water embrace goodness and allow it to make you a better person lets be good lets be helpful lets be kind lets be understanding lets improve ourselves lets improve our communities lets improve our world meaning is always more important than short term detrimental pleasure lets not allow drops of poison or blood to mess with our clear water,1.0,1,2.66,1.14

401947,thats very convenient to think if youve done something bad that way you never have to admit that youre a bad person and can do just about whatever you want and then forgive yourself afterwards no suffering involved with the evil you produce however in my experience with being a human and interacting with other humans people dont tend to change their shitty behaviour on a fundamental level until they suffer for it they can put on a facade of being good for a while that is until they experience more extreme circumstances and their actions are based purely on emotional responses at that point no amount of logically thinking yourself into being a good person will make you one when people seriously suffer for their bad behaviour and i mean seriously suffer so much so that they want to die litterally want to die that is when the change of them becoming a good person is imprinted on the mose base level of their character everytime they become emotional enough to normally revert to their bad behaviour they remember the pain their actions caused them the last time and youll see their face change from anger to a much more mellow look before they are able to act it out this only works if you have empathy of course and are able to suffer when your do something bad hence the comparison to psychopathy,0.8043605387229323,1,1.28,5.11
