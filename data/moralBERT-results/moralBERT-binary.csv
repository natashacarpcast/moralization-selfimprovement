12,just within the last few years i have been comforted by the thought that i am not god and while you may think thats pretty damned obvious try telling my brain that we have amazing powers to imagine we can think things up that dont exist in fact not only can we picture these nonexistent things but they can also conjure up emotions to go along with the story we are telling ourselves it makes for some pretty compelling images this same brain can also recognize the impermanence of things the chaos of our lives its unpredictability etc there are countless examples of having something then not having it anymore or not having something wed never imagined we could have and then having it all the while our brains are furiously creating realities that are coupled with emotions that dont exist and it is the job of the brain to make those imaginations seem real and here is where i have to remind myself im not god my brain has been and will always be wrong on predicting the future no matter how much it would like to think otherwise it is not all knowing it is not able to read minds events situations in a comprehensive way that can justify its claim that the future is going to turn out the way it imagined it i dont know about you but my brain is almost always wrong sure there are times when i can reasonably and somewhat intelligently predict what might happen but when it does happen its always different just enough different to counter its belief that its good at predicting the future i get it youve been single for years and youre losing hope that is a sucky place to be but you are not god and you can take comfort in that thought by insisting to your brain that just as probably that you wont meet someone you could just as easily and probably meet someone false hope i think the real false hope is when we trust our imaginations dont get me wrong they are good for some things creative work problem solving etc but they are shitty for predicting the future putting your hope in your ability to imagine the future is the very definition of false hope live your life keep an eye out for opportunity learn what you can change what you can and leave the things you cant control to the chaos of reality but whatever you do dont fall into the trap of thinking you know the future you do not what was not here today will be here tomorrow you can creatively imagine ways to increase your chances but just as easily you might be going about your routine and bump into that one person you had never see before until that moment i know i know pretty romantic and movie like but the truth is if there is indeed magic in the world defined by having a reality outside your expected reality it is in the fact that the next moment completely and utterly defies our pre knowledge there should be great comfort and not a little fear in that statement edit wow thanks for the gilding and the responses,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,selfimprovement
13,distinguishing the key differences between nice guys and genuinely good men in this world there is a subset of men that believe women are only attracted to assholes which is true if you preface this belief with very few the vast majority of women are attracted to good men the subset of men that believe otherwise are nice guys whats a nice guy nice guy noun a man that displays overwhelming acts of kindness towards women with a firm expectation of immediate romantic or sexual rewards some of the common traits of a nice guy include he puts women on a pedestal nice guys are prone to putting women on a pedestal they do so to the point of making a woman uncomfortable or worse bored they will coincidentally have all of the same hobbies and interests as her they will agree with all of her world views and personal opinions they refuse to say anything that could offend her up until the point she rejects him but well get to that in a moment they are at her beck and call whether or not she becks or calls for it they constantly fawn over her they laugh too loudly at her throwaway jokes they drown her in unnecessary flattery hes dishonest nice guys are dishonest by nature they pretend to agree with everything a woman says they deceive women through the use of emotional manipulation they falsely big note themselves to women they literally tell women im a good guy nice guys are dishonest being a sore loser when a nice guy faces rejection from a woman his response generally involves a two step approach he initially ignores it a nice guy will relentlessly continue his pursuit of a woman despite any subtle initial signals she gives off that shes not interested as such women are eventually pushed to the point of forcefully spelling it out to him im not interested leave me alone he throws a tantrum once a nice guy realises defeat he doesnt keep his cool and move on from the rejection with grace and civility he burns the bridge between him and her until there is nothing left but the charred remains of his bruised ego he calls her a prude or a slut or sometimes both unaware of the irony he makes nasty comments about her personal appearance finally then he caps it off with something along the lines of im out of your league anyway here is an example of how this could play out in an online dating scenario nice guy hello emily you have beautiful eyes i should tell you im not like most guys i know how to treat a girl right if you go out with me ill be the one in the kitchen making you a sandwich hehe emily hey thanks for the compliment nice guy youre welcome so what sort of sandwich can i come over and make for you tonight minutes pass nice guy hello emily hey sorry im at work i appreciate the offer but i just got out of a relationship and im not really ready to meet up with any guys just yet nice guy well thats good cos im not just any guy hehe how about we take it slow then let me take you out for a coffee emily as i said im not ready for that yet nice guy come on i promise im a good guy emily look im not interested ok sorry nice guy ok fine jeez just trying to be nice minutes pass nice guy i bet youll end up dating some jobless loser who treats you like shit hour passes nice guy no wonder your last boyfriend left you women only date asshole losers if you dont want to meet any guys then why the fuck are you on this app in the first place hour passes nice guy fine dont respond slut this sort of interaction begs the question if women are only attracted to assholes why arent they swooning over nice guys because they mostly dont he has no respect for women deep down nice guys have no respect for women this is apparent when you witness the jekyll to hyde transformation a nice guy makes whenever a woman rejects him it is also apparent with the overwhelming approach nice guys take to their pursuit of a woman men who respect women dont check in on them every ten minutes nor do they leave women banks of unresponded text messages on the regular this sort of behaviour is invasive uncomfortable and ultimately disrespectful hes completely unaware of himself nice guys seldom accept fault when a woman rejects them they refuse to consider if i keep sending women uncomfortably flattering messages and not a single one of them responds positively maybe thats on me instead a nice guy carries on recycling the same tired empty messages growing more resentful with each rejection he receives in response a nice guys inability to self reflect and self improve condemns him to a life of bitter cynicism and exponentially painful rejection are nice guys born nice guys or do they become them now that youve read through some of the typical traits of a nice guy youre probably wondering are nice guys born nice guys or do they become them while many nice guys have always been selfish cynical pricks not all of them were born this way some are newly nice guys whats a newly nice guy newly nice guys are those that began their dating life as insecure misguided young men and devolved into nice guys over time let me show you an example of how this happens in this example ill call our pre nice guy guy guy starts speaking to a woman he is overwhelmingly flattering in his approach the woman feels uncomfortable and eventually guy gets rejected guy is heartbroken by the rejection and confused as to why she rejected him after all he was so kind and friendly towards her eventually he gets over the rejection and moves on in search of another guy starts speaking to a new woman just like last time he is overwhelmingly flattering in his approach the woman feels uncomfortable and eventually guy gets rejected guy is heartbroken by the rejection and even more confused as to why it happened after all he was so kind and friendly towards her eventually he gets over the rejection and moves on in search of another as this pattern continues guy becomes a little more cynical and a little more frustrated each time ever heard of the saying the definition of madness is trying the same thing over and over and expecting a different result well thats spot on in the case of how some men become newly nice guys and how nice guys stay nice guys they continue the same lazy ill conceived attempts at seduction over and over expecting someone will eventually take the bait as the rejections pile up they develop a resentment towards women become sore losers and convince themselves into believing that the only reason women dont like them is because women are only attracted to assholes lets talk about good men nice guys and good men are polar opposites while a nice guy is disrespectful insincere overly agreeable and selfish a good man is respectful confident honest and selfless some of the common traits of a good man include he carries out acts of kindness with no ulterior motive good men dont hold the door open for women or compliment their smiles as a way to get her into bed a good man displays acts of kindness towards women because being kind and respectful is in his nature women appreciate acts of kindness when they sense that its being delivered in a sincere ulterior free manner sincere gestures from a man lower a womans defences and increase his credibility in her eyes he treats women as individuals unlike nice guys who let their negative experiences with a few women dictate their views on all women a good man treats women on a case by case basis this is beneficial regardless of the outcome of his past encounters with women when a past encounter was negative he doesnt project his baggage onto the next woman when a past encounter was positive he doesnt set unrealistically high expectations upon the next woman hes a good loser when a good man gets rejected by a girl yes it does happen no matter how painful it feels he knows when to call it quits accept the loss and move on he wont respond to her rejection message demanding she explains herself further he wont accuse her of disliking him because he treated her too well he wont send her insulting messages until she elicits an emotional response hes too busy getting back on his feet and finding somebody else disclaimer the recovery time from a break up is dependent on the length and nature of the relationship im not suggesting good men move on from every rejection quickly and effortlessly he doesnt dote on women good men are rarely accused of appearing desperate in their pursuit of a woman this is namely because a good man wont dote on a woman before he compliments her he senses that the situation calls for it he wont show strong affection towards a woman until he feels the relationship has developed to the point where his affection will be well received and reciprocated he doesnt treat women like poor lost puppies as he sees them as adults who are capable of looking after themselves he is always looking for ways to improve good men are naturally self reflective beings when a good man realises his shortcomings or is faced with rejection he makes a concerted effort to confront his shortcomings and improve himself this is vastly different from nice guys who prefer to blame their problems on everyone else he challenges women good men wont enthusiastically agree with everything a woman says and does if he disagrees with something shes said he will make it known respectfully good men also arent afraid to make fun of a woman in a fun and playful way examples of this include id ask you to dance but you couldnt handle my moves or i dont think you and i are going to work out we should call it quits now after she reveals she doesnt like nandos he is self assured good men know their worth and remind themselves of it often they wont bend at the will of others or let haters alter the views they have of themselves they hold strong to their values and express them with women in a mature are rational manner he respects women good men view women as their peers by treating women as their peers which in fairness all men rightfully should good men reap benefits they dont run the risk of becoming subservient to a woman they dont view women as inferior by expecting immediate gratification for their attempts at seduction therefore their expectations arent constantly crushed leading them down a hateful emotional spiral ala nice guys he owns his insecurities being a good man doesnt mean being free from insecurities sure the average good man has far fewer insecurities than the average nice guy but still he does have them the difference is hes not afraid to admit them where a nice guy will channel his insecurities into bullying others and bringing them down a good man owns his insecurities and looks to address them in a healthy manner the way a good man owns his insecurities is by being open about them and seeking counsel from friends on them considering ways he can alleviate his insecurities by improving himself developing strong empathy and understanding for the insecurities of others based on those he sees in himself final thoughts while the traits listed above provide an underlying framework of what makes a nice guy vs what makes a good man the world is not so black and white some good guys have moments of weakness just as some nice guys have moments of clarity and good if you are guilty of a few nice guy traits and you fear you could become a full blown nice guy please know theres still a chance for salvation my advice to you is to change your mindset and attitude towards women but firstly towards yourself if you dont you are likely to live a life filled with romantic rejection and increasing bitterness towards yourself and others nice guys start being good men good men keep up the good work,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,selfimprovement

23,everything is temporary when i was in prison it felt like i would be there forever that my permanent state of being was uncertainty and pain i felt as though i would be worthless for the remainder of my life once i looked beyond the fear and anxiety i understood there was an expiration date i didnt know when but i knew there was one that alone gave me the strength to endure this is the power of impermanence our perspective dictates our reality is this happening to you is this happening for you one is playing the victim the other is taking responsibility for your life the moment i dropped the victim role which i played for a while i found freedom inside prison this is our choice choice is freedom i found mans search for meaning in the prison library its one of the most profound perspective shifting books i have ever read i reread it once a year this quote is one of many reasons i make that claim everything can be taken from a man but one thing the last of the human freedomsto choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances to choose ones own way when we embrace choice we have agency over our lives when we have agency over our lives we can rebuild we can start over gratitude is a superpower i was sitting in the prison library with nothing to my name i lost everything my amazing wife my career my money my homes and cars i lost my identity and self worth and yet one crisp early morning the sunrise was spectacular i put pen to paper and wrote im grateful for this mornings sunrise i found something to be grateful for in my most challenging time i cannot express how important that truly is adversity can be a gift our greatest adversities do not have to be the end in fact they can be our greatest teachers and our greatest beginnings the choice is ours it begins when we embrace the other lessons,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,selfimprovement

25,my interpretation a common and natural experience of life is to blame others or even the world for its imperfections and the inconveniences and pain it has caused you as one gets older and matures this blame tends to turn inward as we begin to focus on all the ways we have not lived up to our own standards or the problems we have caused in the world there is one final stage however that not everyone reaches which is to to nonjudgmentally accept life as it is and to just focus finding ways to make things better,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,selfimprovement
26,a lot of people are constantly angry because of stuff they see or read on the internet its important to remember that almost none of the stuff you get angry about on the internet affects you in real life people are constantly outraged about all of these controversial figures like elon musk logan paul andrew tate jk rowling ben shapiro alex jones kanye west or jordan peterson but why in the case of jk rowling middle aged british lady who you will never meet in real life says controversial thing on twitter is that what you want to worry about are you going to spend your time on that youtuber scams audience with nfts okay who cares i dont do crypto stuff so i couldnt care less about whats happening in that space there is a whole subreddit dedicated to hating elon musk with over subscribers where people get together and get angry because some african guy said a stupid thing on twitter one of the most upvoted posts there this month is literally musk talking about how he doesnt like chess and prefers more complex games in what way is that something to be angry about when youre caught up in all these online spaces it seems really important but when you stop viewing that type of content you very quickly realise it actually doesnt matter you only have so many hours in your life why spend them getting angry at some guy who said stupid things on your deathbed youre not going to be like i wish i spend more time watching liberals getting owned by ben shapiro compilations youre never going to regret not wasting time,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,selfimprovement

america wasnt founded on freedom america was founded on violent autonomy the ancient greeks had an entirely different definition of freedom it was the ability to choose the right regardless of circumstance we talk about freedom all the time but weve stopped talking about freedom a long time ago now were talking about autonomy freedom is different than autonomy freedom has boundaries truth is one of those boundaries and morality is one of those boundaries autonomy is the ability to do whatever you want whenever you want in whatever way you want the problem is this if im autonomous and another person is autonomous and i have preferences and those matter more than the truth and that person has preferences and their preferences matter more than the truth when two autonomous preference seeking beings come together and their preferences dont match who is going to win if truth is on the bottom shelf truth wont decide what will decide will be power and isnt it ironic that in our quest

real time image of the sun on the observatory wall i nearly wept the sun actually looks like a giant boiling grey brain and then it hit me i have so many assumptions to set aside and so much left to

41,i used to think that if i was a good person things should work out for me i spent a lot of times doing things that were good i put others over myself and thought that meant good things would happen to me and well that didnt work out as i had expected i did everything i was supposed to do and ended up sick tired and miserable because my underlying beliefs were that i needed to do be something other than what i was in order to be worthy i used to be a perfectionist i used to be so tough on myself i never believed i was worthy of good things my outer life reflected that i was addicted to adderall nicotine anorexic or stuck in disordered eating over caffeinated sleep deprived constantly in toxic relationships and in crippling debt i thought poorly of myself based on old stories i clung onto ive healed so much over the last few years but recently i realized that i never stopped to look around to where it got me i never basked in the glory of this moment and i still felt badly about myself i decided to learn different healing modalities and just tune into myself daily instead of thinking of it as work or something to change i now know its something to do to understand my own beautiful uniqueness and capabilities a few weeks ago i had a huge shift i know its because of all of the things ive done over the last few years and because ive finally accepted the fact that i am worthy and fully believe it that feeling hasnt wavered for weeks and i dont see it happening but maybe it will i have tools to help my life today is beautiful and i feel very grateful ive got everything i need and many things i want i have a stable job many things im passionate about and am building a business in addition to my full time job two days ago i had made a mistake a simple one but historically no matter the size of the error it would send me into a spiral im an idiot whats wrong with me and ruin my whole day about it but two days ago i literally sang as if i was a kid i made a mistake and thats ok everyone makes mistakes immediately after i smiled so big because that was showing something deep down inside of me has shifted immensely i just received some praise at work yesterday and i was fully open and knew i was deserving of it it was a big moment as many important people were there to hear it and i was singled out by name i didnt shy away or downplay it i said thank you proudly things are falling together because i finally know that i am worthy i just wanted to let you know that really wonderful things can happen once you focus your energy on you we cant change what we did in the past i spent so much years in shame over things i did when i didnt know better beating yourself up today does nothing but ruin this moment i wanted to share some affirmations as a practice if anyone is interested they have really helped me on my journey i am worthy my past doesnt define me every day i can choose a different way of showing up i deserve the life i want _ tl dr affirmations i am worthy my past doesnt define me every day i can choose a different way of showing up i deserve the life i want edit thank you all for the support im so glad so many of you resonate i have a podcast called everyday perspectives where i unpack topics like this shifting mindset from victim to co creator with life its available on all major podcast platforms if youre interested,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,selfimprovement

47,dont think about you situation too much youll end up creating a problem that wasnt even there to begin with the mind is a very powerful tool everything begins and ends in your mind what you give power to has power over you if you allow it in retrospect if you keep on thinking about a certain negative thing over and over again it will control you mind so far as it will be the first thing youll think of when you wake up and the last thing before you sleep initially it will completely take over of your mind a task thats very hard to get rid of the best way to live life is to stop thinking about the worst instead think positively in a way that whatever happens happens and youll learn from it no matter the situation a massive cause for people to panic worry and become scared is overthinking we are all guilty of this overthinking quite frankly ruins you it will drain everything out of you until theres nothing else left overthinking ruins the situation twists and swirls everything around makes you constantly worry in fear and makes everything worse when in reality there is no need for it understandably saying turn your negative thoughts into positive isnt a walk in the park and doesnt just happen within thin air it takes guts time patience and all your emotions to get through the darkest of days as i said time is crucial it doesnt take a day a week or even a month to get rid of negative thoughts inside of your head it may take a few years to ensure youre ready to let go of all the pain and torment your mind has gone through but believe you me once you realise youre ready and you start to brighten up day by day it will be the best feeling ever you dont get the same day twice in life todays date is september the just a reminder youre never going to see this day again make the most of it edit pms are open for support,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,selfimprovement
48,pornography hollywood and other forms of media have deluded men into false perceptions of women think and how attraction works porn is a falsified artificially constructed representation of human sexuality where attraction and arousal are instantaneous easy and abundant without true effort on the other side mainstream movies i e romance porn often portray unquestioned dedication as the ultimate way to womans heart unremarkable piddling men will win a beautiful woman over through some grand act of devotion reinforcing that idea that men can be mediocre and still attract beautiful women solely through sacrifice logically we understand that movies and porn are fictional but without experience or baseline knowledge these misrepresentations become reality if reinforced early on these contradictory messages that women are owed to us porn and that they must be earned mainstream media have fucked up many mens expectations and ability to handle rejection men who are inundated in this mindset and who have experienced a series of rejections from women begin to view women as a monolithic group that have rejected them in totality who are looking down them from a pedestal rather than understanding that romantic sexual rejection is something that happens frequently and is not a source of shame red pillers incels and puas are born out this they blame women for being superficial or unattainable they use band aids and tactics rather than taking complete accountability an working to become an inherently attractive interesting person even puas who achieve superficial success crumble when they encounter rejection because their identity is largely predicated on acceptance from women our society worships at the altar of the victim its difficult to take complete ownership of your faults and failures i certainly struggle with taking ownership at times this is not a pro feminist post this concept applies to both men and women you and i completely responsible for our successes and failures not anyone else women are not owed to you the same way your attraction owed to anyone else women did not have a secret global meeting and deem you unworthy everyone experiences rejectionthose who imply that they dont experience it are delusional or liars you are not victim your attractiveness or any other facet of your personality is not static your success solely depends on personal accountability and willingness to experience discomfort in order to grow edit fault should be replaced with responsibility but the same concept applies edit this post got me permanently banned from the social skills sub,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,selfimprovement

60,i used to really struggle i had self esteem issues organizational issues would procrastinate and fail classes however in the past few years i started focusing on improving myself and since then ive bought a house significantly advanced my career receiving top performance ratings and other accolades and ive been able to pursue hobbies and grow my relationship with my girlfriend of years hopefully soon to be fiance i think dating her made me realize that i had to straighten some of my own stuff out and thats probably what initially set me off down this path of personal improvement here are a few key points i picked up along the way i needed to learn what my values are this is an exercise from the habits of highly effective people by stephen covey btw this is my personal development book ever definitely read it or at least the spark notes if you havent already imagine you die and youre attending your own funeral either as a guest a ghost etc imagine various people from your life are speaking at your funeral this might include your parents spouse coworkers friends etc what do you want them to say about you when i performed this exercise i realized that i wanted people to remember me as loving and supportive inspirational hard working to provide hope and alleviate suffering both in my local and global community etc i wrote these things down and it eventually evolved into my personal mission statement a series of bullet points that summarize the values i want to embody in my daily life i try to read this daily or at least a few times a week it keeps me centered on what is truly valuable in my life so that i can make an effort to focus on those things rather than getting caught up in the distractions this is a great first step ideally everything in your life should be aligned with your values theres also a phrase i appreciate memento mori latin for remember death it sounds morbid but if i think that these next minutes could be the last minutes i have then it makes me reflect on what im currently doing and if its how i want to spend the last few minutes i have does it align with my personal mission statement is writing this reddit post really how i want to spend my last minutes yes yes it is ill come back to this later i needed to learn self awareness this is sooo important if you are more self aware youll be able to notice your emotions and actions and if they are aligned with your values if you notice that you are feeling depressed stressed angry etc then you can do something about it if i notice that im stressed out then i might make adjustments to my plan maybe before i go interact with others i try to spend an hour at home either taking a nap or a bath or exercising or whatever to help calm my nerves its all about practice to become more self aware you can try journaling to reflect on your day life you can try meditating or you can even talk with someone you trust and reflect on your lives actions these things have all helped me out it also takes practice experimentation to understand what works well or doesnt work well to help you out when youre in these various states of mind for example if im feeling depressed ive found that i shouldnt watch tv or play video games but exercise going outdoors and spending time connecting with loved ones is very beneficial i needed to learn how to focus on what truly matters there are two parts to this eliminating distractions and then working on important value added activities eliminating distractions understanding my values has helped me to focus on the right stuff and self awareness has helped me to realize when im focused and if im not focused then whats causing the distraction growing up and all the way into my early s ive always been very disorganized and distractable however i realized that if i can eliminate the distractions then it gives me space to freely work toward those things that align with my values eliminating distractions is a constant journey and there are literally distractions in every part of my life here are some examples and what i did about them facebook social media yes even reddit i often found myself mindlessly scrolling through these online platforms often for more than an hour each day i deleted the apps from my phone i then found myself going through my phone internet browser so i even found how to block the website from my internet browser emails i realized my inbox would get filled with tons of stuff each day most of which didnt add much any value to my life i unsubscribed from almost all emails and when an email no longer needs my attention then i archive it physical clutter did you ever have an essay due tomorrow and youd find yourself cleaning the whole house to distract yourself maybe its just me anyways i have been on a journey of eliminating those little things that might distract me do i really need shirts so i spend minutes sorting through them and figuring out the perfect outfit nooooooo you can probably tell this is basically minimalism minimalism can get some strong reactions from people so i was hesitant to use that term but yes ive adopted many minimalism philosophies practices completing value added tasks i personally really benefit from checklists it helps me to keep track of what is important and i find a lot of satisfaction in completing the things that are important and then crossing them off the list i started using an app called todoist on my phone and computer and its great because im so distractable i have literally everything on that app haha it sounds a bit ridiculous but it even includes things like brushing teeth and making the bed also i believe in the rule spend of the effort to get of the impact you can always go back later and put in more effort if you get some time but its important to keep moving onto the next goals for example when lifting weights i focus on the big squats deadlifts and bench press if i only have minutes to work out i want to make sure i get the biggest bang for my buck there are three general categories of tasks to focus on sustainment tasks these are things like exercising eating healthy getting enough sleep practicing good hygiene and caring for loved ones these are crucial because if they get neglected then eventually i will find myself in a situation where i am not free to work toward my dreams for example if i neglect my health then i will get sick which will drain me of energy and money two essential resources tasks that eliminate distractions and streamline the sustainment tasks these are tasks like purging old items clearing your calendar etc for example i like to meal prep it saves time and money and ensures i have a healthy diet i also use instacart to help save even more time tasks that move you forward toward your vision these are tasks that align with a dream or vision that you have maybe you want to start up a non profit so taking steps toward that or maybe you want to start a family so taking steps toward that taking steps toward owning a home i needed to practice financial responsibility fortunately ive always naturally been a frugal man so this hasnt been as big of an issue for me as it is for some people financial freedom is truly invaluable it provides opportunities to expand your knowledge and work freely toward those value added tasks mentioned above if i relied on the next paycheck to get through the next few weeks then that gives my boss power over me he can say i have to work hours next week and not get paid for that overtime and i dont have as much freedom to tell him to eff off i have experienced some very tight financial circumstances and it can be extremely stressful this isnt meant to be a guide on how to save money and grow wealth i definitely suggest investing some time and energy into learning about finances if you havent already i had to learn how to effectively communicate ive never been a person to openly talk about feelings

69,as human beings we naturally ping off the people around us to dictate how we should behave unless youre drugged out of your mind or something haha the people you talk to are subconsciously looking at your behavior to let them know how they should behave if youre uncomfortable and rigid you send signals to the other person that they should be uncomfortable and rigid as well if youre judging yourself negatively youre telling the other person that youre going to judge them as well if youre stuck in your head and youre overthinking what the perfect thing to say is youre showing the other person that they should be worried about what they say as well being way too harsh on yourself is the most common problem i see with people trying to work on their confidence or their conversational skills and if youre personally experiencing these problems i understand the struggle i know its not as simple as just relax and dont think so much so how do you take that comfort that you feel with your close friends and carry it over into all your other social interactions its about letting go you have to let go of the need to be perfect you have to remove the pressure that you put on yourself these are limitations that youve put on yourself and only you can remove them when you can do this and when you can treat the person youre talking to as if they were a friend they will subconsciously receive signals that they are allowed to feel comfortable as well its magic you will feel like youre doing nothing at all and yet get compliments from people that you are so easy to talk to the journey to becoming the most confident version of yourself is not always comfortable but its worth it if you need help with this lets have a conversation comment down below with what you need help with if im not able to answer anyone im sure someone else with great experience will be able to help you out lets work together to create amazing social lives p s if youd really like my help specifically feel free to send me a message i respond to those quicker cheers,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,selfimprovement

76,this is not written by me but i had to share it with all of you because this is not some temporary trick to achieve days target it is a step by step guide for the complete reboot to completely change your approach towards quitting porn and tackle pmo in the right manner ive shared it in a few other subs because i want to reach as many people as possible it is extremely long but trust me it will change your whole perspective of quitting this addiction just read written by theunderdog porn addiction is being severely underestimated how do i know this because most people in the community believe that in order to get rid of this addiction all they have to do is keep trying over and over again until eventually things will just click and their brains will finally become rebooted very few are treating this as atrueaddiction they just see it as a habit they want to break this is evidenced by the stubborness of many relying purely on willpower for months only to constantly reset their counters and beat themselves up for not making any progress most people dont realize howincredibly difficultit is to completely remove artificial stimulation of any kind for the rest of their lives were talking about years and years of brain conditioning here were dealing with some powerful stuff here but it is not treated seriously enough probably because its widely accepted by society and is not a substance like heroine or cocaine i cringe when people relapse reset their counters and proclaim this is it ive had enough im going to do it this time stop kidding yourself this is an addiction that has to be attacked frommanydifferent angles you need a full arsenal of tools and strategies as well as a proper mindset willpower alone wont do shit abstinence isnotrecovery what people usually try to do is go as many days clean as they can thats all they do thats all their goal they achieve a certain amount of days then for whatever reason they relapse so they start over and repeat that is abstaining that is not recovering it is extremely common for people to achieve a certain milestone such as or days relapse a few days later and then find themselves unable to get momentum again they go back to the beginning and they feel like they lost all their progress from their run there is a constant frustration for lack of progress people are feeling overwhelmed and discouraged trying the same thing over and over again without success this is because very few are addressing the real roots of their problems very few everyone is focused on how many days they have managed and if their symptoms are either present or gone they judge their progress by measuring dick hardness spontaneous erections and morning woods they are trying to quit porn so that they can get rid of their ed so they abstain for as long as they can hoping that this can cure their symptoms completely wrong approach if they dont see ed improvements they get discouraged if they see ed improvements then maybe a porn session or two wont hurt right if there is no woman around they justify watching a couple of times after all they are not having sex anytime soon so whats the point they delay dating until their ed is cured or they have managed to go days but they never achieve this in the first place precisely because of this incorrect mentality the same applies to other symptoms such as social anxiety energy levels motivation etc they try to quit porn so that the symptoms can go away and so they can finally live life people are focusing on the wrong things they are not changing the way they think they are not changing the way they live they are not changing the way they view sex and women they are just trying not to masturbate while everything elseremains the same that my friends is abstinence not recovery the foundation of a proper reboot porn addiction is not the cause of your shitty life read that again of course its difficult to improve your life when youre having intense porn sessions every single day that drain your energy and make you a zombie but porn is not the reason your life sucks please this is very important to understand you have to stop blaming porn for your problems this mentality of life awaits me after recovery isdestructive porn is not the reason youre a procrastinator porn is not the reason youre depressed porn is not the reason youre lonely porn is not the reason you havent been able to lose weight or gain muscle porn is the symptom you watch porn to escape reality you watch porn to manage your emotions you watch porn because youre bored lonely stressed depressed angry isolated you watch porn to feel good for a moment to replace uncomfortable emotions and situations in your life heres how you get rid of this addiction you dont focus on quitting porn so you can finally get to live life after youre recovered you focus on learning how to live how to manage your emotions how to change the way you think and view the world you put all your energy into building the life you want this will naturally lead your mind away from porn success is not measured by how many clean days youve managed its measured by how much your life has improved since you started rebooting this is what you need to do step write a life vision for yourself how do you envision your life a few weeks months or years from now spend a whole day or week thinking about this dont say i dont know what to do with my life are you telling me you haveno cluewhat you want in any of the following areas study work family friends hobbies health etc even if youre not sure you need to give your life somedirection this is by far the most important part of recovering from pornography addiction write like crazy write many pages if you want make the biggest post youve ever done in your journal talking about how you envision your future life this life vision will be the foundation of your reboot this is what you will focus on from now on close your eyes visualize it write it down if you dont know what you want in life then this is actually a more serious issue than porn addiction itself like i said spend a whole week if you need to brainstorm ask for advice take a notebook and go to a park inspire yourself this is the beginning of your recovery take it seriously step give urgency to your life vision ok now you know what you want in life even if youre still unsure in some areas such as not knowing what to study thats ok at least you can give your life some direction for the moment this is very important you need to give your life direction you need to move towards something heres the problem many of us know what we want but we keep delaying it were experts at delaying goals we wait until new years or the beginning of a month or until circumstances get better so this is what youre going to do now youre going to giveurgencyto your life vision write down why you absolutely must start working on it right now make another huge post or journal entry about it lets suppose youre and you have no job no car still live with your parents and spend most of the day playing video games why in the world would you wait more time before starting to do something about it this is urgent bro youre fucking or maybe youve never had a girlfriend in your life before well what are you waiting for go buy some nice clothes start going out more frequently make mistakes get rejected ask women on dates start getting some experience now you have back pain start working on it dont wait the more you wait the worse it gets start doing yoga or swimming move your hips and back constantly every day write down reasons why you must start pursuing your life vision right now you have to stop living like this this is urgent this is high priority we must convince ourselves that change is imminent its very important a life vision is no good if you have no urgency youll just keep delaying it waiting for circumstances to improve waiting for motivation to arrive waiting for the beginning of new year create urgency step develop an indestructible belief in yourself one of the main reasons we quit goals is because deep inside we dont believe were actually able to do it when successful people like arnold schwarzenegger decide they want to achieve something they become completelyobsessedabout it they have an indestructible belief that they will achieve it they are not affected by circumstances they create results in their head before they even get them this is what you have to do if you want to accomplish anything for example lets say you want to learn how to play guitar and you have the urgency to do it because you know it takes time so the sooner you start the better you have to start now however after a few days of learning the basics you start losing motivation and becoming discouraged you realize that playing guitar is not easy at all you feel overwhelmed by how much practice you need to put into it you start doubting yourself and thinking theres no way ill ever become a great guitar player and form my own band friends tell you things like dude you shouldve started years ago all great guitarists started when they were young so you quit this is a result of a weak belief in yourself you dont believe you have the potential to become a good guitarist which is obviously completely false we as humans have unlimited potential arnold schwarzenegger doesnt think like this look at what he said how many times have you heard you cant do this you cant do that its never been done before i love it when someone says no one has ever done this before because when i do it that means im the first person thats ever done it this is how we should think when we set up to do anything in life uncertainty is what kills people not knowing if theyre able to achieve it we need to brainwash ourselves every day into believing that wewilldo itno matter what all of these steps are equally important do not skip them they are the foundation of your reboot they make rebooting so much easier your mind will be completely focused on what you want in life you will be fixing the root of all your problems the secret of change is to focus all your energy not fighting the old but on building the new stop making posts complaining about your shitty life stop making posts saying how youre sick of being addicted to porn stop talking about porn altogether instead transform your journal into a self improvement journal focused on moving towards the life you want forget about porn this is basic rebooting stuff yet many people are constantly breaking this rule they write about porn cravings morning woods spontaneous erections what day theyre on how much they struggled to abstain how they cant wait to reach days etc when you consistently focus on building the life you want your mind will naturally move away from porn you will also lessen the void left by quitting porn which is very real many people quit porn only to find themselves in this life emptiness that is very hard to handle then they go back to porn precisely because this void is too much for them focusing on your life vision is a superior rebooting approach relapses arent that discouraging if youre actually improving your life ironically you will notice that the more you focus on what you want the less frequently you will relapse its important that you think in terms of life vision and pursuing your dreams not in terms of i have to get busy and fill my life with activities so that i dont watch porn this is something youre doing for yourself stop ranting about porn this journey is about yourlife focus on that and the porn will go away managing your emotional life ok lets keep going porn addiction is much more than just getting cravings and relapsing one of the reasons we become addicted is because of our inability to manage our emotional lives you have to remind yourself that quitting porn is about growing up and becoming a much more mature person its much more than i want to quit porn so i can cure ed and have plenty of sex with women much more than that weve been using porn for years as a method of handling our emotions we need to stop hiding away from uncomfortable life situations we need to stop using porn in order to escape from reality we must learn how to handle life and emotions without the need of porn we need to understand that one of the reasons we relapse is becausewere pussies that cant handle negative emotions we use porn as medication we use porn to hide away from life we use porn to temporarily relief anxiety stress loneliness boredom anger etc readjusting your sexual expectations this is by far one of the most difficult things to do when you quit porn youre not just saying good bye to artificial stimulation youre leaving behind the world of never ending flow of hot chicks with big tits and round asses real life isnothinglike that weve been spoiled by porn we believe that we should be out there having lots of sex with different women we believe that this is the key to happiness and fulfillment the problem is that it isincredibly difficult and unrealisticto fuck hot chicks on a regular basis theres nothing particularly wrong with having that goal but you have to be willing to take some massive action you have to go through hundreds of rejections you need to have a lot of balls you must do what of men are incredibly afraid to do how many people here are doing what it takes to have the kind of sexual life we all dream about very few if any we see these super hot chicks on tight dresses and we hope that maybesomedaywe might be able to have sex with them we read books about seduction we visit pua forums we watch videos on youtube of guys approaching girls we make theories and discuss them online but we arent doing shit about it its all just a dream an idea we have in our minds something we hopesomedaywe will do heres how most people get laid in real life a guy meets a girl he finds attractive so he asks her out they get to know each other then they continue to go out and form some sort of relationship then after some months the relationship either becomes serious or falls apart thats the real world you have to accept that unless youre willing to take massive action you wont fuck anywhere near as many women as you expect to accepting this is very difficult but it is necessary we need to learn how to live without this world of endless hot chicks otherwise well become extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with real life which is nothing like porn anyone here is more than capable of getting a girlfriend but our girlfriends most likely wont look like pornstars nor they will act like them theres a very high probability the sex wont be pornographic in nature theres going to be a lot of sensuality caressing and also clumsiness some days your girl will look sexy other days not so much some days shell be in the mood other days she wont some days youll struggle to keep it hard other days youll cum too fast she might be able to achieve orgasms or she might not you might do it every other day or maybe only times per month remember pornstars are paid thousands of dollars to do what theyre told and fulfill all your fantasies you must stop living in dream land i know this is very difficult to accept but we have to give meaning to our lives outside fucking hot chicks our happiness cannot depend on that otherwise youll keep coming back to porn every time you fail to get laid in real life you will remain attached to sex with hot chicks for the rest of your life you have to change the way you view sex and women because i can assure youit has been completely distorted by porn by the way i dont believe theres anything wrong about pursuing casual sex instead of a relationship just make sure you keep both feet on the ground i would also like to add that relationships are about sharing your life with another person i know many people here want a girlfriend so that they can finally start getting laid but relationships go much more deeper than that if youve never had a girlfriend before youll know once you get one thinking about sex isuseless whats the point of fantasizing it accomplishes nothing it slows down the reboot increases the urge to masturbate and reinforces neurological pathways related to porn its a meaningless activity that should be eliminated it keeps your mind focused on sex tits asses fucking when it should be shifted towards other activities in life if you find yourself thinking about sex you should mindfully and calmly redirect your attention to something else you want sex great then do something to actually make it happen fantasizing by itself serves no purpose at all you need to understand that if you want to abstain from orgasm and masturbation you cannot be thinking about sex and women because this will inevitably cause you to relapse trying to abstain while at the same time fantasizing or peeking at pictures of chicks will only lead to frustration stay away fromanykind of artificial stimulation dont take peeks dont browse pictures of girls online dont type pornstar names on google image search dont read escort forums do not arouse yourself basically you have to adopt a philosophy of im either trying to get laid approaching texting girls going out on dates flirting with women hanging out with friends getting rejected or doing something completely unrelated to sex work studying exercise fun reading playing an instrument chores housework watching movies there is no grey area where you are alone thinking about sex or checking out girls online this accomplishes nothing it serves no real purpose it will only increase urges lead to relapse and make you frustrated as soon as erotic thoughts pop up in your mind you should calmly ignore them and refocus your attention to something else you keep practicing this forever until you master it you have to attack this addiction right from the root trying to abstain from hardcore porn accomplishes nothing if youre still constantly fantasizing and peeking if you keep strengthening the mindset i talked about above you will be making meaningful progress this used to be called monk mode but i dont like that name because it implies that youre going to become celibate this isnt about becoming celibate this is about doing what it takes if you want to get laid instead of wasting mental energy on sexual thoughts that will only improve the chances of relapsing if you ever want to achieve a long streak you cant be checking out girls online even if its just some bikini pictures you cant be fantasizing when you wake up in the morning you cant be taking second peeks at porn as soon as you do any of those things this huge beast called porn addiction will take control over your prefrontal cortex and its just a matter of time before you relapse you have to be extreme but dont worry its much easier than it sounds its actually harder to stop yourself from relapsing once youre already thinking about sex than it is to not think about sex in the first place how do you not think about sex simple focus your mind on your life vision every single day dismissing erotic thoughts as soon as they arrive in your mind is the cornerstone for preventing relapses this is basic stuff guys its not orgasm what you crave many people here believe that abstaining from orgasm is the most difficult part of rebooting wrong when you get porn cravings your brain is not asking for orgasm as an addict it is begging you for your hit it misses the high the tits the asses the novelty the rush the unrealistic sexual scenarios the fantasies the super hot chicks the perfect camera shots the feeling of letting go and indulging in pleasure the fucking the cumshots the doggystyles the boobs bouncing around etc if lack of orgasm was the problem then everyone would just fap without porn or any other artificial stimulation there would be no relapses and everyone would have day counters the urge to ejaculate only becomes a real problem once you start peeking edging or fantasizing constantly when you find yourself in a state of arousal then obviously you will want to cum but the initial urges are addiction urges they are mental they are not a physical need for ejaculation if you feed these urges by peeking even if its just pictures of hot babes in bikini then they will invade your mind and rob you of your ability to concentrate or remain calm eventually autopilot mode will be engaged and we all know what happens next youre not having urges to cum youre having urges for a high and a rush remember that this is why porn urges dont go away when you get a girlfriend it is adrug and you need to learn how to live without it regardless of whether you have a girlfriend or not when you abstain for several days or weeks your sensitized pathways are anxiously waiting for any sexual cue no matter how short or brief this is why people mistakenly confuse real libido with porn cravings they take a peek at porn after days and they feel this intense rush and urge to cum so they conclude that it is libido and that they must relieve pressure the problem was taking a peek in the first place had they just focused on more important things instead they wouldve been able to finish the day clean without problem if you manage to completely abstain from fantasizing and checking out chicks online in any form then going a long time without orgasm wont be a problem and dont even think about testing or caressing your dick focus on your life vision counters vs spreadsheets the following advice is aimed particularly towards those members who are having trouble getting a good run if youre already doing good you can skip this section ok heres the thing there is a sickening obsession with long streaks on this forum people like counters because supposedly they are helpful for tracking progress well guess what spreadsheets do a much better job at that theres a reason why im so stubborn with this anti counter thing they are dangerous destructive counterproductive counters reinforce the idea of being back to zero every time you relapse making it way more justifiable to binge before starting over again not only that but you completely lose track of how many times youre actually masturbating they dont show the whole picture there is absolutely no way to measure your progress at all its a never ending cycle of abstaining for a few days and then going back to zero every time you reset your counter you become increasingly discouraged and unmotivated theres too much emphasis on what day youre on no fap challenges there are currently no fap challenges running its ridiculous days days etc if youre consistently unable to get past xx days and youre always in the low numbers then your counter has lost its purpose counters are only good when youve managed a good run because this gives you a sense of accomplishment and provides sufficient accountability to actually prevent relapses sometimes now lets talk about spreadsheets they keep your addiction under control by keeping track of how many times youre actually masturbating and having orgasms you will be forced to keep it in the low numbers if you relapse the spreadsheet will discourage you to binge especially when youre sharing it with the forum a good rule of thumb is to try to keep your orgasm count to less than per month they allow you to see the full picture in gameovers words you dont realise how you forget over a month how many times you actually masturbate peek pmo or orgasm until you have it in front of you i thought i was well under orgasms a month but i have been up around and this month was no better youll be surprised at how many times youre actually fapping they completely eliminate the counting factor all you have to do is keep it as clean as you can pretty cool eh no more counting no more day goals no more fap challenges after all were trying to quit porn for life not just days or whatever they will never discourage you if you do relapse you input it on the spreadsheet and move on you dont make a new thread called relapsed again or not making any progress trust me if you went from fapping times per month to times per month youre making huge progress even if your counter only says days spreadsheets arenota taper off approach of course the goal should always be to never watch porn to be as clean as you can to take it one day at a time tapering off as in i watched porn times last month so ill watch it times this month will never work you should never think like this you should never give yourself the green light to pmo ideally you shouldreplaceyour counter with a spreadsheet and completely forget about what day youre on then if you do manage to get on a good run you can put your counter back up for accountability and motivational purposes however i understand many people here are in love with their counters they look pretty they are fancy i get it i get it so this is what i propose once again this only applies to people who are struggling if youre already on day or whatever then dont change anything but consider using a spreadsheet if you do end up relapsing conclusion to sum it up the typical rebooting advice of hey man just do a day reboot is basically useless this is a very serious addiction and should be treated as such willpower alone wont do it change the way you live change the way you think and please stop making so many posts about porn cravings urges relapsing erections days etc instead focus on the most important thing your life gotta clarify some things i have never said that the reason westartedwatching porn was because of life problems in fact i would argue that is not the case for the majority of us i didnt have any childhood issues or family problems when i was young i just discovered porn on my own and liked it because it was very pleasurable as kids and teenagers we are curious and horny however as years go by we become dependent on it not only because of its extreme addictive nature and accessibility but also because we start using it as a way to cope with life the reason westartusing porn and the reason wecontinueto use porn once were addictsarent necessarily the same i also didnt mean to say that all porn addicts have shitty lives actually by shitty all i mean is being dissatisfied in one way or another maybe you constantly put off your goals or maybe you waste a lot of time online and want to change that that doesnt mean your life is shit it just means it could be better i am completely aware there are exceptions there is a guy who told me he had no problems getting instant makeouts and fucking chicks the same day he meets them there are others who actually have incredibly busy lives and only watch porn to get some pleasure and relax whatever your situation is the main point of my post still stands you should focus on moving towards what you want instead of constantly complaining and wasting lots of energy on staying away from porn concentrate on building the life you dream about and this will help you tremendously on your quest to overcome your addiction to porn,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,selfimprovement

86,introverts typically prefer interacting with smaller numbers of people rather than large groups take more time to open up to strangers and dont mind being alone as much although it sounds contradictory introverts can be outgoing being outgoing means being friendly initiating an interaction with someone in a positive manner a trait not solely reserved for extroverts although it may not come as naturally and requires more work to get into that mindset an introvert can be just as charming when interacting with a stranger out in public as mentioned previously being introverted often means being more at ease being alone which is powerful and is the biggest deterrent against neediness on the other hand being shy is the biggest impediment to being good with women or with people in general it doesnt matter if you are handsome jacked wearing amazing clothes if you cannot hold a conversation or are constantly feeling insecure you dont have a chance out there being shy means being closed off emotionally defensive self conscious and fearful of the opinions of others it is rooted in the fear of rejection there is no magic solution to prevent shyness and build self confidence it is different for everyone therapy group activities saying hello not creepily to strangers when out working out are actions to consider however the most important thing to remember is that being shy is not a static quality that only introverts exhibit it may require more initial discomfort but introverts are just as capable of being attractive and socially competent as an extrovert,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,selfimprovement

90,behind procrastination there is negative affect thoughts feelings moods about a particular task or the outcome of that task sometimes it is related to a fear of failure low self esteem lack of confidence feelings of incompetence etc these hidden anxieties paint the task in negativity and we end up delaying the task we participate in aversive tasks which make us feel better in the short term to cope with the negative mood induced by the task the proposed solution is emotional regulation choose the task you procrastinate bring aversive and negative emotions thoughts associated with the task into awareness instruct yourself to tolerate those negative emotions such as boredom fear of failure fear of judgment feelings of incompetence etc address those emotions by regulating your emotions in a structured manner begin with allowing those emotions to exist do not suppress them then tell yourself that you are strong tough and resilient finally ascribe more emotional meaning to the task and emotionally commit to that task source in the comment section,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,selfimprovement

118,my whole life ive been concerned about how people perceive me i want to be liked loved and accepted this is a human need since we are social creatures having experienced my fair share of abandonment loss and grief in my life at an early age i developed some thought patterns that thought these needs werent being met so i clung to the need even more and molded myself into taking action that i thought everyone wanted me to take instead of what i actually wanted i constantly agreed to things that i didnt want to do out of fear that i would be abandoned once again if even only in the thoughts of other people thinking that i wasnt lovable or likable because i wasnt doing what they wanted of me this trend continued in my life in so many ways id mold my personality appearance desires paths all in the name of being acceptable in someone elses opinion one day i finally cracked beaten down by an adderall addiction voluntary starvation at a job i hated a college major i despised in a fake relationship i thought was the best thing i had going for me i existed as a hollow shell who didnt know who she was there had to be another way so i had to flip my life as i knew it upside and do everything i thought i shouldnt do so i could finally find myself once again one of the common habits ive always had is saying yes to what i dont want to do because its what someone else wants from me i didnt realize though that every time i did that i was actually saying no to something for me if i spend my time doing something i dont want to do with resentfulness i say no to the time i could be spending doing something for myself and my own inner peace this also applies to things that have absolutely nothing to do with others such as my own thoughts or actions this morning i set my silent alarm for and an actual sound one for because i wanted to go running before work i went running on monday too and that was the first time i did so in months i woke up the earliest i have in so long on monday and the whole day i was grounded and confident and felt good since i had been dealing with a lot of anxious thoughts the last few months i knew something had to change so i took control of what i could when the alarm went off i debated getting up at the moment but didnt then the sound alarm rang and i immediately had the thought if i say yes to staying in bed what am i saying no to this was a surprising thought because its not one that every really came up before immediately at but i also feel its just proof of the inner shift through thought work and self improvement that are sticking i was saying no to doing something good for my body yoga and running i was saying no to feeling accomplished i was saying no to alone time which is rare since my boyfriend and i both work at home and we dont do anything because of covid so time by myself is harder to come by these days i was saying no to all of these wonderful things compared to saying yes to staying in bed which is what i did for the past few months and it didnt make me feel good when i just ignored my alarm or internal clock that woke me up but i decided to sleep and ended up more groggy and just rolling out of bed right before i had to sign on for work so saying yes to something you dont want to do becomes more of an obvious issue when you think of what youre giving up opportunity costs i guess for my business people theyre real and they impact our lives in many ways i thought i was doing good deeds when i said yes to something i didnt want to do but truthfully i was also saying yes to resentment and saying no to so many other things that would be better use of my time energy which are our most important resources i invite you to ask yourself next time you feel an obligation to say yes in order to please someone else whats the cost what are you saying no to making informed decisions instead of ones out of fear of rejection or abandonment has been such an important tool for me on this journey im not perfect at it but i know every time i evaluate this i feel a million times better because i usually end up choosing the one that is best for me,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,selfimprovement

138,one of the biggest myths that many buy in to is that there is only one special person out there for them this limiting mindset leads to neediness a willingness to please putting their partners on a pedestal and other self sabotaging behaviors if the relationship doesnt work someone in this frame of mind will waste precious time and opportunity on their ex who either rejected them or just simply isnt compatible this flawed belief of the one leads to fixation on an idealized fantasy version of their ex not the real person that persons negative qualities and the issues in the relationship are overlooked or ignored because romantic hopes are being projected onto them instead of realizing that things ended for a reason do not buy into the myth there is not one single soulmate for everyone based purely on population numbers there are a multitude of people that you would connect with its tragic to see this opportunity traded in for fixation on an imagined idealized version of someone the best relationships come when there is mutual prioritization trying to convince someone to take you back will typically yield the same results for whatever reason they felt they didnt need you in their lives at some point enough to cut things off even if you manage to win them back they still inherently do not value you once the infatuation fades again the same issues will typically come to the surface again,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,selfimprovement

144,all of us want to wake up with an abundance of energy and motivation everyone wants to have unlimited amounts of willpower and discipline yet our lives do not always turn out to be that way as soon as we turn off our alarm clocks we begin our mornings with social media and youtube after wasting precious minutes we get up broken and sleepy we rush to our bathroom to do our business to rinse our faces and brush our teeth we hastily make our breakfast which contains nothing except tons of carbs and unhealthy fats we brew our cup of coffee and start to fill our bodies with rubbish another minutes later and we gotta go to school work where we spend hours sitting this is the way most of us live we crave change we can feel that something isnt right however are we ready to act on that its not easy to refuse to eat hollow foods its not easy to lay your phone aside and sleep its not easy to go for a run if you are tired of seeking the perfect routine or habits youve come to the right place there will be no bullshit and there will be no controversial topics spoiler alert you already know most of the stuff im going to tell here however why the hell did you not implement it huh reading my post wont alter you you need to actually commit to the habits i present here to perceive the tangible change sleep if your sleep schedule is fucked up and you have no desire to fix it then you can go fuck yourself with your meditation exercise and proper nutrition i cant emphasize how important this point without proper rest your incredible diet or training will be almost useless your ability to remember and recall information will decrease dramatically and you will not live your life to the fullest and thats not everything sleep deprivation is a dangerous thing that can increase your chances of dying earlier than you expect but i dont have time i have to do my homework hang out with my friends and eat pizza bullshit how many hours do you spend on youtube or social media hours hours well then its time to set priorities brother either your health or additional hours of scrolling through endless news feeds diet stop eating junk stop eating shit for breakfast stop filling your stomach with garbage in the evening buy some veggies and fruit try to eat more protein and fibre dont forget about the vitamins and essential metals once a week or two weeks allow yourself to eat some chocolate or crisps dont be stupidly harsh your body wont like it exercise walk ride a bike do some push ups just get your blood flowing man dont be afraid to experiment and change your routine sometimes as well instead of running try to cycle instead of doing calisthenics pay a visit to the gym or boxing class but if i do cardio and weights i will burn all my muscles and become a skinny dog are you a professional athlete who is capable of becoming the best are you a man woman who earns money from sports no then why do you limit yourself to one sport your goal is to be healthy and vital not to show off your six pack to girls reading my brother has his sword king robert has his warhammer and i have my mind and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone if it is to keep its edge thats why i read so much jon snow i like the way george r r martin addresses this point in the first book of his series the song of ice and fire he compares books to a whetstone he is not lying many studies have been conducted by famous universities and they discovered the same thing it doesnt matter what you read the process of deciphering symbols on paper is challenging for our brains dont forget to mix it up and get out of your comfort zone occasionally if youve been reading sci fi for the past two months pick up non fiction or some kind of biography reading books in a foreign language is an incredible way to increase the benefits of reading to their fullest your brain needs to accomplish more work and strain more however thats a topic for another day mediation again so many studies have been conducted on this subject and im sure that youve seen tons of articles and videos on youtube about it in minutes a day you can improve your mood fluid intelligence focus self control willpower and other things if you only have spare minutes that is the best way you can spend them i especially advise meditation to those who are suffering from anxiety disorders it will do wonders for you listening even if what they are saying is wrong listen do not interrupt then after they finished ask them questions about their point of view try to walk in their shoes and understand the way they think maybe you dont know or missing something perhaps you are mistaken and they are right you wont come to a conclusion with mere interruption and arguing thats another human being in front of you not a monster who is trying to deceive you progressive overload progressive overload is a concept i took from the bodybuilding community its a method of increasing your muscle size strength and endurance by gradually increasing the stress you put on your nervous and musculoskeletal systems in other words it means to progressively increase the difficulty of an exercise to stop yourself from hitting a plateau or doing whats comfortable if you want to advance in this life if you want to reach new heights you gotta apply this technique you are not going to create your dream body or a giant business by meditating and sitting on a couch i challenge you to do at least one uncomfortable thing every single day and observe the way your life will transform by the way dont forget about rest

controlling i had a new crush i decided to message him on facebook asking him for his number i had never done something like that before but i was the new me the outgoing girl the one who people liked so i showed no fear he told me later when we were dating he had the messenger open to ask me for my number anyway our relationship was really good in the beginning i was confident we loved each other he lived at campus during school and was studying to be a mechanical engineer i was newly accepted into a prestigious business school in the city for accounting we seemed to have it all when he graduated he was a year younger than me and i was still in school we decided to move in together i got a full time job while going to school full time he was working full time as a mechanical engineer i had been depressed but the adderall helped me do what i had to i would work hours and go to school for hours afterwards leave at get home around i was drowning i realized i didnt want to do accounting but i couldnt tell him that because how would he like me if i wasnt who he thought i was he didnt know i took adderall he didnt know i was still smoking cigarettes when we told each other wed quit together he didnt know me at all it wasnt his fault i was scared to show anyone the real me i was anxious about the double life i was leading everyday i hated myself and believed if i showed anyone who i really was i wouldnt be accepted so i kept the charade going for a while then he found my cigarettes he caught me in lies all the time i quit the full time job because i was so depressed i stopped attending a lot of classes he was exercising a lot and eating healthy i was not eating at all except for when id run out of adderall and binge we stopped liking each other he couldnt trust me because i always lied i dont blame him i lied to myself everyday so how could i be authentic to anyone else i stopped taking adderall and thats when shit hit the fan i started reading spiritual books and doing self improvement i became involved in a spiritual community that helped he thought it was a cult i stopped smoking cigarettes and realized that i had been living a lie for so long i gained a lot of weight and was in a deep depression again from withdrawals and dealing with things that were suppressed while taking adderall i didnt want to go out much i didnt want to do anything whenever i tried to talk to him about how i was feeling hed shut me out he didnt have the capacity to deal with me i realized the relationship was doomed because i had not been myself the entire time i was finally beginning to understand who i was and he hated it more each day we broke up after a snowboarding trip i got stranded on top and he thought i was overreacting when i fell i was a hypochondriac so i cant blame him for not believing me but i was really hurt i couldnt get down and had to be taken down by two professionals he wouldnt drive me to a hospital until we got home he didnt talk the entire hours even after we got pulled over twice for speeding i moved out two months later by myself we lived in an apartment above his grandparents i was still recovering and was just off crutches but he wouldnt come assist his grandparents couldnt believe it i turned and was single for the first time in my adult life i didnt know how to do dating apps i didnt know how to be by myself i realized that was my problem all along i was always clinging to people because of my deep rooted fear of abandonment id mold myself into someone i wasnt because i didnt like myself or love myself id play a part and i was done i did a lot of self improvement over that year my dad was really sick with parkinsons and dementia my mom got cancer it was a whirlwind i lived with them in a tiny apartment until they decided they were going to move to florida i got a new part time job and then it turned into full time because of my hard work i started to prioritize my health after seeing what my dad and mom were going through i decided that i had to take care of me instead of worrying about filling some void too many things were going on that were more important than me trying to date again i moved into an apartment above my cousins house when my parents moved i was essentially living by myself for the first time since i didnt have to answer to anyone i loved the freedom i could come and go as i pleased i started to really dive into spiritual practices i viewed my abandonment issues and started to heal them i realized that everyone i ever dated served a purpose but i jumped into relationships for the wrong reasons i dated two people short term and realized rather quickly i couldnt keep doing that because i was constantly needing to validate myself through someone else i was done with that part of my life i realized deep down i never believed i was worthy id jump into things immediately and ignore all flags i wasnt a good girlfriend because i didnt know how to love myself at all i didnt do a good job in my previous relationships which is on me but i also chose people who werent a good fit no matter what we wouldnt have worked out for the long haul i decided enough was enough i deleted all my dating apps and decided to focus fully on me without worrying about someone else a few days later i received a text saying my phone broke i hope were still on for tuesday it was from someone i was talking to on the dating apps and really felt he was different until he ghosted me he worked minutes from my job and we had agreed to go out after work on may i had decided that day instead of monday because it was anniversary of my first dads passing which is always a weird day for me i decided to give him the benefit of the doubt and we went on our date i showed up not trying to be anyone but myself i was tired of pretending i had accepted myself for who i was flaws and all and no longer cared about what other people though about me because if they dont like me then thats fine were still dating and just moved in together its a relationship i couldve never had before i started to love myself and realize i deserve respect and trust i dont do anything to self sabotage in it because i dont fear being abandoned if its meant to be it will and ill try my very best to make it last im honest about all the things i was never honest about because

161,there was an interesting experiment concerning workers who werent saving up enough money for their retirement the researches made them visualise their future self which included everything from digital visualisation to writing letters to myself in years these people started saving up a lot more than before and the scientists were like ahh the reason we dont care about our future self is that its too abstract we literally cant connect to it without some hardcore computer stimulation great work guys problem solved so today i was thinking about every time i self sabotaged in the past everything from binge watching a show instead of sleeping to that one time i didnt submit my masters thesis on time which set me back about years and i realised its not that i didnt care for my future self i love my future self i always imagine her to be way more together than i am now and also wise and successful possibly looking great for a middle aged woman but then theres the past self what i realised today my relationship with her is much worse and that often comes up when im about to make an important decision like with that masters thesis i hated myself for procrastinating the previous year so i kept on procrastinating because working hard would be an act of self love and all i felt was self hate so the future self suffered i still suffer the consequences in some ways actually though its been years i am that future self hello meanwhile what is the past self doing she doesnt exist unlike the future self which does in some ways shes more real than the present self zen masters would disagree so i guess my conclusion is the best thing we can do for ourselves is forgive and forget the past self let her go and do something wholesome right now,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,selfimprovement

179,i used to waste my days playing video games watching youtube netflix and tiktok and doing pretty much nothing my apartment was a mess i only went shopping when there was literally nothing left in my cupboards i stayed awake until late at night am slept in and got out of bed around noon i jerked of at least once a day which caused my brain to be foggy pretty much all the time what did i change its not really about motivation or some great inspiration or anything like that those are impulses that come from outside they may be effective for a short amount of time but definitely wont last for long you have to change your mindset to be more specific you have to change your mindset about three things attention time progress attention pretty much anything out there is begging for your attention youve clicked on this post because it got your attention you watch that youtube video because it grabbed your attention you get on your phone because the notification sound got your attention pretty much any plattform game etc you spend time on makes money off of your attention they run ads they make you subscribe to their services they dare you to buy the new expansion pack or spend some money on ingame cosmetics dont be so careless with your attention these platforms get you hooked by giving you tons of dopamine as a reward for your attention which is released by colorful funny and loud videos a bunch of likes and comments under your latest post or cool adventures in video games be aware that this is happening to you every day time time is something we actually have a lot of but somehow it still always feels like there is far to little of it why is that assuming you sleep hours a day and spend hours making and eating food leaves you with still hours of time every day what can you do with that amout of time lets say it takes about hour to clean up your house apartment thats just of the spare time you have every day studying for hours a day wont even consume half of the time you have left if youd work those hours even for minimum wage h youd get more than and most of you reading this will earn more than minimum wage where does all this time go it goes where your attention is if your attention is on dopamine bombs like social media video games and the like then your day also suddenly has little time left you end up feeling bad about it and try to drown your sorrows with just more dopamine even spending hours a day on studying will give you hours worth of knowledge a week and make you feel way better than before be aware that your time follows your attention youve got enough time to do anything you want or have to do time is not the problem what you waste it on is progress progress is believed to be linear and thats a big mistake its easy to think that simply putting in twice the amout of time will bring twice the results but thats a myth at first progress will go very slow thats why youre not able to change your habits in one week why you cant just turn your life around and keep it that way progress is slow at the beginning but gets faster and faster instead of jumping in big steps and using up all your motivation and energy you can better take smaller steps dont take on a lot of things at once just one at a time once that thing is really working you can move on to the next one because something is already working well it gives you more motivation for the second thing for the third thing and so on this thing can be anything you want a habit a hobby a skill etc progress is exponential it starts slow and the more you walk across that path the faster and better things will go you only have to stick through the slow initial phase after that exponential growth will do most of the work for you youll just have to keep investing time and attentions if you feel inspired now and want to completely rebuild your life starting tomorrow you may not have fully understood my statement its fine if you want to change something after reading this post but as i said dont rush it if you use up all your motivation within a few days youll feel empty down again so youll start craving for dopamine and go back to your bad habits if you want to change something change just one little thing tomorrow the day after tomorrow change another little thing take a small step into the right direction every day nothing more nothing less youve reached the end of this post i guess that means its time to get off of reddit and start doing something usefull lets see how clean your apartment can get in just minutes i hope you have a nice day,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,selfimprovement

188,edit the response to this has been pretty positive so if any of you have recommendations for other books i can condense let me know i usually make these sorts of lists for myself as i read self help stuff so let me know if i can save you from wading through pages of personal examples and woo woo magic i read adam kisiels how to be an attractive man a few years back and thought it had some pretty solid advice some of it is common sense but a lot of times its easy to forget to do the obvious the book is marketed toward men but im sure a lot of the advice is universal for anybody who wants to attractive friends lovers or just to feel more confident in themselves if you enjoy this list please consider buying the ebook on amazon p s im not adam kisiel p s s as with any advice take all of these with a grain of salt i dont follow all of the tips written here and i didnt come up with them p s s s i paraphrase a bit in this list and lift text directly out of the ebook in places regardless all credit and ideas here go to adam kisiel unless i explicitly note otherwise in a parenthetical face wear a face cream with uva uvb protection at least spf every day to prevent wrinkles it wont stop you from tanning and will keep you looking young groom your eyebrows once a week whiten your teeth either annually at the dentist semi annually with a whitening kit or you can do it like me and swish with hydrogen peroxide every night use a night face cream with tretinoin or any other similar retinoid this is again to prevent wrinkles be honest about your hair if its receding dont try to hide it if youre balding just go for a buzz cut or the full shave if its thinning and youre not ready to let it go keep it short embrace who you is my own interjection but if youre male and can afford it opt for a barbershop rather than a salon barbers make a living cutting mens hair sleep hours night keep a regular sleep schedule if you wear glasses match them to your face size rule of thumb frame shape contrasts the shape of your face frame size should match the size of your face go for simple classic looks cut your nose hair once a week wash your face in cold water every day a good burst of full cold water in the shower should do ya stop touching your face it gives you acne and leads to scarring if youre picking at acne and makes you look insecure body eat right figure out what this means for you eat more real protein more vegetables fresh fruit and whole unprocessed grains cut down on the fried food track what you put in your body if it helps stop eating sweets and snacks all of the time let the treats be treats drink a lot of water im a lb male fairly active and i can usually put down liters a day if i put my mind to it buy a nice reusable water bottle and take it with you everywhere if you drink opt for wine over beer in moderation its good for the heart less calorific than beer and pairs with quality food if the weather is tolerable and walking biking is an option then walk or bike good rule of thumb is if you can get there in minutes or less walking or biking then walk bike exercise just start with two days a week an hour a day you can do cardio or you can lift you can go on hikes you can bike you can skate just move speaking of exercise go to the gym if you can afford it youll have access to a ton of equipment and the atmosphere can serve to push you harder also a great place to meet people eat protein after you work out note im not sure about the validity of this one anyone care to confirm this or raise evidence to the contrary take care of your feet cut your toenails regularly use foot cream once a week or so and wash them when you shower get in the habit of walking with a straight back you can do this by strengthening the muscles in your back pull ups with wide and pronated grip are a good one for this and by reminding yourself to straighten your back throughout the day get rid of the belly its basic physics everybody burn more energy than you consume sweets soda beer simple carbs all enemies do some running even once a week is fine dont make it a chore enjoy it you can sprint you can jog you can alternate between walking and running whatever your body was made for this include shoulder exercises in your workouts muscular shoulders are a big part of the quintessential manly appearance stop smoking i dont think i need to list the reasons why if you cant quit switch to vaping personality read at least one book a month surely there is something youve been meaning to read go to a bookstore or a library download the

your scope expand to your budget if money is tight become a local expert on cool places near you instead of buying stuff spend your money doing cool stuff if people want to be around you because of your stuff then they arent really friends be empathetic toward others think about the interests feelings and motivations of others frequently be dependable when your friends or family need you be there its the right thing keep up to date on whats going on around you this way when youre on a date with friends or just bored youll know whats going on and where to be do things you enjoy often do things that make you happy mix up your entertainment if you play games all of the time go see a play if youre always out with your friends read a book stimulate your brain with variety the world isnt going to come to you dont stay at home too much be where other people are make stuff happen most people tend to be afraid of initiating things so be the one to set something in motion call your friends invite people out learn some cool go to places to take friends visiting family dates clients etc have a good coffee shop restaurant bar park etc know your city expanding on this know some cool hole in the wall places to take people take people somewhere they likely would not have visited if it werent for you only ever use pick up lines if a youre trying to be funny b you can pull it off and c it isnt the only idea you have for conversation just be yourself dont be fake stop swearing all of the time use precision f bombs instead of a barrage of swear words mind be self confident even if youre just faking it because everybody else likely is too smile relax and keep your composure dont fall prey to analysis paralysis take action pursue it and hope for the best try things for yourself have your own opinions and express them openly without any fear dont follow the majority because everybody is doing it and dont reject what is popular just because everybody likes it base your actions and decisions on what you find right embrace challenges when tasked with something that youve never done before or that you dont know how to do dont just give up try it and try your best worst case scenario youve gained some experience stop thinking negatively all the time youre going to fail in life probably a lot thats just probability but thats also the cost of success when you do fail dont be dissuaded from trying again take your newfound knowledge and experience and make a more educated crack at it if you want to meet somebody be the one to make the first move its better to try and to fail then to dwell on the what if be aware of attractiveness isolation it is the phenomena in which attractive or intelligent creative talented etc people intimidate others so much that they give up right away thinking there is no chance to appeal to them if you think somebody is too whatever for you try getting to know them anyway you may be one of the few who try and hopefully succeed know what you want and be decisive remember that you have to come first in your own life unless you know kids dont rely on stereotypes the main function of stereotyping is making one feel better about oneself by depreciating others an attractive man feels well because he knows his own qualities so dont comfort yourself by the perceived flaws of others remember that people are people with their own motivations desires fears prejudices thoughts and inner worlds they are not categorized objects and they are not devices to be used treat people as people justly and with respect get closer to the people and things that make you smile and laugh laugh daily its healthy and everybody finds cheerful people more interesting than depressing people its infectious remember that youre never too old for anything if there is something you would like to do than do it when other people talk listen with your full attention be confident enough to truly be present and listen to people dont use the other persons turn in the conversation to think about what you plan to say next if you really need to think before you speak take a pause you dont have to gab any time theres a silence clothing note i dont follow some of the pricier or more fashion forward tips here as im an undergrad student living off of student loans but follow what you can if it suits you change your underwear to black wear boxer briefs or something shorter if you prefer whatever you feel comfortable in avoid boxer shorts covered with fun patterns match your socks to your pants and throw away socks with holes wear clothes with fit this is the single most important principle in the area of clothing try on clothes before you buy them pants should stay in place without a belt and should brush against your shoes shirts and jackets should fit well on the shoulders and as narrow in the waist as is possible without reducing comfort blazers are a classic timeless piece of male clothing they fit a variety of looks and can be worn no matter the weather just stick with lighter fabrics in the summer and remember always leave the bottom button unbuttoned have at least three white shirts you can wear them under jackets and blazers and with the right trousers and shoes a white shirt can give you a great classy summer look always opt for long sleeves when you can as you can always roll the sleeves up have at least one pair of classic elegant oxford dress shoes black are the most versatile always dress just a little bit better than the situation requires dont overdress or underdress find a good watch dont waste money on something cheap if you cant afford something that youre happy with then save until you can note the author says to avoid digital but i like my apple watch make your own choices take proper care of your shoes shoe maintenance keeps shoes alive and saves you money as does buying higher quality shoes that wont wear out as quickly if you have time clean and polish your shoes weekly with sport shoes just toss them in the washing machine and set it so slow spin mode when finished put some old newspaper inside and let them dry out match your clothes by color try to follow the two color rule a main color and secondary color two thirds of your outfit should of the main color the rest the secondary color white and blacks excluded avoid looking like you have been trying to hard with your clothing remember that the best dressed people look completely at ease and like they just happened to put on things that look cool not like theyve obsessed over it when going to an event with a partner in business friendship or love dress to match them dont underdress when theyre in a suit and tie conversely dont show up in a full suit when theyre in shorts and t shirt avoid wearing clothing that are only intended for special tasks hiking boots are for hiking flip flops are for the pool next time you shop for clothes bring a brutally honest friend with you to give advice dont ask sales associates they are there to make commission no shame if your friend tells you you dont look perfect dont be offended they are helping you if you can pay ore for long term clothing like suits jackets coats and shoes go for quality and keep it simple and classic so it doesnt go out of style wear your formal clothing around the house every once in a while so you look natural and comfortable in it that way at weddings and funerals you wont be adjusting your suit jacket or tripping over your heels every five minutes if you are short dont wear long coats and jackets if you are tall dont wear short coats or jackets unless youre into the funhouse mirror effect twice a year move the clothes from the back of your wardrobe to the front you may rediscover stuff youve forgotten about or you may find stuff you dont like that a thrift store or charity would love dont wear sandals with socks just dont hygiene and grooming take a shower everyday buy a body scrub get some simple soap and scrub your body especially chest armpits groin butt and feet you can wash your hair every other day but shampoo it when it gets greasy eliminate bad breath in addition to flossing and brushing daily be sure to brush or scrape your tongue if you have white discoloration on your tongue you most likely have bad breath brush that junk off remove excessive body hair you dont have to be as smooth as the day you were born but it isnt the seventies anymore easiest way is to get an electric razor with guards put the guard on it stand in the shower with the water off and shave until everything is even use google as tips for anything further always use deodorant and find a cologne that suits you splurge on this if you can when you do find your cologne use it daily people will start to associate this smell with you you should probably get rid of any back hair you can wax use an electric hair remover or opt for permanent hair removal if you can afford it i just shave off the little bit of fuzz i get on my lower back so i dont have a ton of experience here clean your ears including trimming hair poking out of them wash your bedclothes at minimum once a month the more frequently the better do it on as high a temperature possible to kill bacteria fight excessive perspiration if deodorant isnt cutting it ask your doctor about professional antiperspirants have a few towels and change them at least once a week always keep a fresh spare too in case someone who is over needs one launder them frequently you can wash these with your bedclothes in high temperatures dont use cheap razors go for normal thats non electric razors with sharp and durable blades if you use cosmetics make sure they are made for your skin type and tone its men can and do use cosmetics a sunscreen with a bit of tone works wonders for covering up acne living habits learn a sport if you have a friend to do it with do it together if not find something you can do solo it doesnt have to be every day it just has to be regular it can be anything as long as its something that you will look forward to when it comes around go to the theatre at least once every three months theatre is a broad form you dont have to go see a musical at your local high school there are raunchy comedies dark and gritty thrillers and everything in between this assumes you live in a large enough city to have access to good theatre do as many ordinary daily activities as you can outdoors eat outdoors read a book in the park go on a walk with your business partner instead of meeting in the office have a hobby or two what turns you on what makes you feel alive excited thrilled what keeps you up at night find that and do it learn how to cook obviously you can never completely learn how to cook but take the time to learn a few basic skills that will allow you to throw some meals together when around others who are familiar with cooking watch them as they do it and ask them questions about it explore music genres that are different from your favorite one ask a friend for their five favorite albums listen to the bests out of different genres i think this should apply to media in general books movies games just keep exploring if you can afford it and you really like animals adopt one from a shelter be responsible for it feed it groom it make sure it gets proper medical care and make a new best friend drink more alcohol but in smaller amounts at a sitting get buzzed and sociable instead of wasted and incoherent know your limits clean your home once a week a pleasant looking home makes you feel a lot better and look a lot better also helps in case of an unexpected guest get rid of things you do not use there are many decluttering methods out there i like the konmari method assign a separate bin section of closet for clothes that you have already worn but are still clean enough to wear again try to diversify income sources easier said than done but if you can find a way to make even a tiny bit of money doing something you really like to do and you already have a sufficient main income then make that side income get rid of services that suck up your wallet how many online services are you subscribed to how many of them do you use how many of them do you need cut the cords and pay fewer bills do not watch porn be someone who meets real people pornography is an unsatisfactory substitute and a completely unrealistic one to boot i know this is a controversial one i am of the belief that pornography makes it more difficult for me to appreciate people in the real world warts and all treat yourself every once in a while if theres something you really want to do have or experience but you feel it is too expensive or unnecessary just do it life is about spending your time in

206,first of all i cant wait to be berated in the comments im gonna be blunt i have seen a whole lot of dumb shit over the last week a lot more than normal and compounding all of that is an unprecedented amount of legitimate emotional involvement here so let me get started by saying outright that people getting emotionally involved with trading stocks always lose short long whatever it doesnt matter if youre a year old throwing in your life savings or bill fucking ackman not being able to admit he was wrong with herbalife letting your emotions be a major factor in trading is a fantastic way to lose money and a whole lot of you are really emotionally involved with this gme amc whatever to the point i am not making a buy sell hold whatever recommendation i have no special insight in to whats happening with gme or whatever else what i can tell you is that it is for sure not worth so lets dispel one quick thing this is not david vs goliath it also isnt the little man vs hedge funds or wsb vs big finance it might have started out that way but if you only read one thing read this many of the big retail brokerages including robinhood route a lot of their customer orders to citadel securities so it ends up seeing a large percentage of retail trades in u s stocks it can see if retail traders are mostly buying or mostly selling or mostly pretty balanced you might expecti certainly expectedto see that retail traders were buying more than they were selling this week the stock seemed to be rocketing up on frenzied retail sentiment and the posters on wallstreetbets were all claiming that they would never sell and keep buying until it hit but heres what citadel securities retail flow looked like in gamestop this week graphic here retail investors were net buyers on monday but net sellers for the rest of the week through yesterday and all in all quite balanced about of retail orders that citadel securities saw were to buy and were to sell what do you make of that one reading would be retail investors on reddit might have started the gamestop rally but theyre not piling into this stock now and the price action this week is coming from professionals or as one twitter user put it past the retail ignition the rocket ship was mostly intra fast money warfare so just to be clear about this there is massive institutional money on both sides of this trade and retail is a toddler sitting at the world series of poker understand that melvin does not need to cover in the way a retail trader needs to cover you and everyone else have no idea what melvins position looks like and they can reorganize and exit a position before you ever knew it happened you dont know how hedged they are you dont know what their collateral looks like and you dont know if theyve covered and restructured a short at last weeks prices you simply dont know you only know whats been presented in the news which is almost certainly bullshit this thing could come to an end as fast as it started and you wont know what happened for weeks you might go take a shit at today and come back to gme trading at because ken griffin got on cnbc and announced they restructured their short at an average price of and were happy to sit on it make no mistake youll get kicked in the nuts and have your ball taken away faster than you can comprehend emotions the problem with this whole strike back at wall street narrative is that lots of you are getting really worked up over this trade losing money sucks but losing money and feeling like you got shit on by the big guy is going to hurt this isnt a moral crusade to them its billion dollars so if youre out here putting money and emotions on the line that you cant afford to lose there wont be a happy ending want to fight the good fight against wall street write your congressman tweet aoc or ted cruz get you a fucking picket sign and go wave it around on the streeet but dropping money on gme that you need in life aint gonna change anything except your net worth tldr know and understand who is playing this game and that they have access to tools leverage and markets that you do not youre playing le chiffre at casino royale right now you might think youre james bond but theres a good chance that youre just the fat dude in the corner short squeezes end fast as fast as they started if youre new to trading then understand buying gme at this price can mean all of your money will evaporate before you had time to make a tiktock about it get your emotions out of play here this whole nonsense political narrative is only going to cause you to make trading mistakes cant handle that then maybe its not a good idea to sit at this table lastly if you really just cant get yourself out of the whole fight the hedge funds nonsense at least understand that youre spending money that you likely wont get back if thats worth it to you then have at it but dont fool yourself in to thinking

208,this is kind of part of whats been happening so here are some links to the first posts as well as a link to the original post on wsb about this story original post my broker questrade wants me to sign an nda saying i wont talk shit about them after offering me usd as compensation for losing from outages post questrade legal contacted me post original post on wsb got a call from police regarding threats to questrade last night i was read some of the posts you guys made on their sub so in the original email where they mention legal action they accused me of threats extortion and defamation we ask that you remove these posts immediately and you cease to use social media to post defamatory and misleading statements about questrade in an attempt to extort funds from the company if you do not remove these posts you are put on notice that this will become a legal matter our legal department are already investigating two prior posts you made where you stated that you were ready to burn down the building as well as making the following statement if i cant get my money back ill be sure they lose an equal amount in whatever way i can obviously the quotes in the email dont provide full context but the cops understood that and read it back to me paraphrasing here but this is the comment regarding burning down the building what is going on with questrade support this is such a joke it pretty much feels like all theyre saying is too bad so sad and fuck you honestly getting tired with this i feel like im going crazy getting ready to burn down the building what a joke so obviously i was saying it as a figure of speech in a time of frustration and not serious in anyway regarding it but regardless questrade took it to the police the other comment about if i cant get my money back ill be sure they lose an equal amount in whatever way i can was meant as in them losing potential current clients commissions obviously i didnt mean any harm which i clarified in my reply to the original email basically the police cautioned me and said they dont think i was serious the call i got was around est and i asked if they usually call this late and the officer said that they were just getting to it cause they had more pressing matters assuming just a waste of police resources in general if you ask me especially during this time like the guy from the tradedesk said to me in an email to keep things in perspective the world is reeling from a tragic situation thousands of people have lost their lives our staff have been working around the clock to help our clients get through this unprecedented crisis in response to our genuine attempts to find an amicable solution you have threatened and insulted our staff i urge you to think about your actions i would urge questrade to think about their actions the officer also asked me if i was the one writing posts about questrade killing someones wife and i think something about hitler but i was able to clarify that it wasnt me writing those posts and it was other people who were likely upset just find it pretty ridiculous that police had to waste their time going through screenshots sent by questrade of their sub not sure why they would waste the polices time with this but it ultimately resulted in nothing it was in my opinion obvious that those comments were both said out of frustration and i removed them along with all comments at the request of a questrade employee as well anyway i think what people should take away from this though is how poorly questrade is treating its clients if i were to phone them and be upset i dont want to be scared of potentially having a criminal charge brought forward on me because they took something i said out of frustration seriously and involved the police honestly think their handling of this matter has been incredibly unprofessional throughout upsetting to think this was a company i used to admire and recommend to countless people even just a few days before all this happened i was recommending them to friends its amazing to me how poorly theyve handled all this and how in less than weeks my opinion of them has done a complete what a joke im sure you guys worked this out for yourselves but just want to point out how its weirdly convenient that they saw the threats last week but the police only contacted me after i refused to take down my posts about them hours after the deadline questrade gave me to take down the posts proof i was contacted by police since some people think i am lying about it ________________________________________________ guys if you want to help get the word out and potentially save other canadians from signing up with this nightmare of a broker please tweet this thread at questrade or business insider or marketwatch or bloomberg or anyone else that can write about it i dont have an active twitter account so cant really do it myself but would appreciate it immensely i think its important for canadians to know that they could potentially get contacted by the police if they say something to their broker out of frustration or anger people should know what kind of company they are dealing with you can also email the news tips email on sites with links to these threads if you want thanks guys edit to contact cbc and gopublic cbc ca ______________________________ edit to those saying im in the wrong i can agree that i shouldnt have said some things but what i want to point out is this i understand that but if they were worried about the threat why did they wait until after my second round of postings to bring it up why wasnt i contacted by police sooner regarding it how is it that police only contacted me about hours after the deadline they gave me to take down my posts had passed if there was a concern of safety they had screenshots of the posts thursday march at pm est at the latest how is it police only contacted me april at est hours and minutes after the deadline had passed police also had screenshots of posts made on mar and mar obviously i cant know but it seems like they only went to the police after i refused to take down the posts heres a more clear timeline step lose money step post about it on r questrade and only r questrade on every single post and warn people step mod on r questrade asks for my number step tradedeskguy calls me to talk to me step tradedeskguy says hes gonna see what kind of compensation he can get me step tradedeskguy asks me to remove my posts while he is going to bat for me no joke he really said that while i review your complaint below can you do me a solid and remove repetitive posts on wherever you posted online you can keep your original complaint if you wish your entitled to vent your frustration but there are limits to that we have thousands upon thousands of happy clients which you were probably one of prior to the outages and you spamming the boards is giving your bias it is not a fair representation of questrade nor does it help when i go to bat for you i was told you already apologized to those responsible for responding to social posts so i thank you for that thanks step i comply and delete even my original complaint step receive offer step decline offer and post about what happened everywhere i can think of step get asked to remove my posts again by tradedeskguy i have just been notified that you have posted information from our private discussions on reddit these discussions were confidential and constituted good faith attempt to resolve your complaint your reddit posts are inaccurate misleading and contain defamatory content as we discussed you incurred a loss as a result of trading in high risk options which you failed to mention in your posts we ask that you remove these posts immediately and you cease to use social media to post defamatory and misleading statements about questrade in an attempt to extort funds from the company if you do not remove these posts you are put on notice that this will become a legal matter our legal department are already investigating two prior posts you made where you stated that you were ready to burn down the building as well as making the following statement if i cant get my money back ill be sure they lose an equal amount in whatever way i can if we do not receive your confirmation by on march that you will discontinue posting defamatory content on social media you will leave us no choice than to commence legal action to keep things in perspective the world is reeling from a tragic situation thousands of people have lost their lives our staff have been working around the clock to help our clients get through this unprecedented crisis in response to our genuine attempts to find an amicable solution you have threatened and insulted our staff i urge you to think about your actions step i dont step mar passes step hours later i get a call from the police regarding the threats

do your own research take anything i write with a grain of salt and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch also full disclosure i hold a net long position in gme but my cost basis is very low average i have to admit the drop today was too tasty so my cost basis went up from yesterday share with my later buys averaged in and im using money i can absolutely lose my capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours in this post i will go a little further and speculate more than id normally do in a post due to the questions ive been getting so fair warning some of it might be very wrong i suspect well learn some of the truth years from now when some investigative journalist writes a book about it thank you everyone for the comments and questions on the first and second post on this topic today was a study in the power of fear courage and the levers you can pull when you wield billions of dollars woops excuse me im sorry hedge fund guys i meant trillions of dollars i just briefly forget you control not just your own but a lot of other peoples money too for a moment there also for people still trading this on market based rationale as i am it was a good day to measure the conviction behind your thesis i like to think i have conviction but in case you are somehow not yet familiar with the legend of dfv you need to see these posts fair warning nsfw and some may be offended triggered by the crude language the last two posts might be impressive but you should follow it in chronological order and pay attention to the evolution of sentiment in the comments to experience true enlightenment anyway i apologize but this post will be very long theres just a lot to unpack pre market disclaimer given yesterdays pre market action i didnt even pay attention to the screen until near retail pre market im less confident in my ability to read whats going on in a historical chart vs the feel i get watching live but ill try early in the pre market it looks to me like some momentum traders are taking profit discounting the probability that the short side will give them a deep discount later which you can reasonably assume given the strategy they ran yesterday if theyre right they can sell some small volume into the pre market top wait for the hedge funds try to run the price back down and then lever up the gains even higher buying the dip buy side here look to me like people fomoing and yoloing in at any price to grab their slice of gainz or what looks to be market history in the making no way are short side hedge funds trying to cover anything at these prices mark cuban said free markets baby mohamed el erian is money in the bank as always upgrade in quality on the pandemic drop was the best clearest actionable call while most were at peak panic and boy did it print your identifying the bubble as the excessive short vs blaming retail activity is money yet again also the pain trade sorry later interview segment i only have on dvr couldnt find on youtube maybe someone else can the short attack starts but im hoping no one was panicking this time weve seen it before looks like the momentum guys are minting money buying the double dip into market open cnbc please get a good market technician to explain the market action buy side dominance sell side share availability evaporating into nothing look at day by day volume last few days this thing is now at runaway supercritical mass there is no changing the trajectory unless you can change the very fabric of the market and the rules behind it woops i guess i should have knocked on wood there if you know the mechanics whats happening in the market with gme is not mysterious at all i feel like you guys are trying to scare retail out early for their own good with all sincerity to your credit rather than explain whats happening possibly you also fear that explaining it would equate to enabling encouraging people to keep trying to do it inappropriately possibly fair point but at least come out and say that if thats the case outside the market however wow you thought yesterday was fear this is fear ok short side people my hat is off to you just when i thought shouting fire in a locked theater was fear mongering poetry in motion you went and took it to whats even better yelling fire in a theater with only one exit that way people can cause the financial equivalent of stampede casualties absolutely brilliant robin hood disables buying of gme amc and a few of the other wsb favorites other brokerages do the same even for people on margin man and here i thought i had seen it all yesterday side note i will give a shout out to td ameritrade you guys got erroneously lumped together with rh during an early cnbc segment but you telegraphed the volatility risk management changes and gradually ramped up margin requirements over the past week no one on your platform should have been surprised if they were paying attention and you didnt stop anyone from trading their own money at any point in time my account balance thanks you i heard others may have had problems but ill give you the benefit of the doubt given the ddos attacks that were flyiing around robin hood seriously wtf im sure it was totally coincidence that your big announcements happen almost precisely when what has to be one of the best and most aggressive short ladder attacks of all time starts painting the tape what looked like a ddos attack on reddits cdn infrastructure pretty certain it was the cdn because other stuff got taken out at the same time too and a flood of bots hit social media ok short side this last one is getting old taking out a large scale cloud cdn is real big boy stuff though so i wouldnt entirely rule out nation state type action those guys are good at sniffing out opportunities to foment social unrest anyway at this point as the market dives i have to admit i was worried for a moment not that somehow the short side would win hah the long side whales in the pond know whats up but that a lot of retail would get hurt in the action that concern subsided quite a bit on the third halt on that slide but first a side lesson on market orders someone printed bonus bank big time and someone lost i feel your pain whoever you are during the face ripping volatility my play money account briefly ascended to rarified heights of figures it took me a second to realize it then another second to process it then as soon as it clicked that one glorious moment in time was gone what happened during the insane chop of the short ladder attack someone decided to sweep the jan call contracts but they couldnt get a grip on the price which was going coast to coast as iv blew up and the price was being slammed around so whoever was trying to buy said f it market order i e buy up to x xxx xxx worth of contracts at any price this is referred to as a sweep if funded to buy all most of the contracts on offer hft shops snipe every contract at each specific price with a shotgun of limit orders which is far safer but something only near market compute resources can do really well for retail or old tech pros if you want all the contracts quickly you drop a market order loaded with big bucks and see what you get but some clever shark had contracts available for the reasonable sum of or something around that i was too stunned to grab a screencap the buy market order swept the book clean and ran right into that glorious nigh obscene backstop limit so someone got nearly per contract that was at the time theoretically priced at around loss per contract maybe im not giving the buyer enough credit you can get sniped like that even if you try to do a safety check of the order book first but especially in low liquidity environments if a hft can peak into your order flow or maybe just observes a high volume of sweeps occurring they can end up front running your sweep pick off the reasonable contracts and slam a ridiculous limit sell order into place before your order makes it to the exchange either way i hope that sweep wasnt loaded for bear into the millions if so ouch someone got cleaned out so the lesson here folks in a super high volatility low liquidity market a market order will just run up the ladder into the first sell order it can find and some very brutal people will put limit sells like that out there just in case they hit the jackpot and someone did if youre on the winning side great it can basically bankrupt you if youre on the losing side my recommendation just dont try it i wouldnt be surprised if really shady shenanigans were involved in this but no way to know normally thats crazy type talk but after today peeking at order flow and sniping sweeps is one of the fastest most financially devastating ways to bleed big long side players just sayin edit so while i was too busy trying not to spit out my coffee to grab a screenshot u piddlesthethug was faster on the draw and captured this ok so i guess my in the moment mental math was off by about man that hurts just thinking about the guy who lost on that trade back to the market action a ray of light through the darkness so i was worried watching the crazy downward movement for two different reasons on the one hand i was worried the momentum pros would get the best discounts on the dip ill admit i fomod in too early unnecessarily raising my cost basis on the other hand i was worried for the retail people on robin hood who might be bailing out into incredibly steep losses because they had only two options watch the slide or bail all while dealing with what looked to me like a broad based cloud cdn outage as they tried to get info from wsb hq and wondering if the insta flood of bot messages were actually real people this time and that everyone else was bailing on them to leave them holding the bag but i saw the retail flag flying high on the market halt iirc and i knew most would be ok what did i see you ask why the glorious bid ask spread wsb reddit is down those crazy mofos give you the finger right on the ticker tape ive been asked many times in the last few hours about why i was so sure shorts werent covering on the down move this is how i knew for sure its in the market data itself edit so theres feedback in the comments that this is likely more of a technical glitch man at least it was hilarious in the moment but also now i know maybe not to trust price updates when the spread between orders being posted is so wide maybe a technical limitation of tos ill admit i tried to one up those bros with a limit sell order but it never made it through im impressed that the hft guys at the hedge fund must have realized really quickly what a morale booster that kind of thing would have been and kept a lower backstop ask in place almost continuously from then on im sure others tried the same thing occasionally and other high dollar asks would peak through from time to time from then on which told me the long side hfts were probably successfully sniping the backstops regularly so translating for those of you who found that confusing first such a high ask is basically a fu to the short side who as you remember need to eventually buy shares to cover their short positions more importantly as an indicator of retail sentiment it meant that no one else was trying to sell at any price lower than absolutely no one was bailing out i laughed for a minute then started getting a little worried holy cow no retail selling into the fear how are they resisting that kind of price move the answer as we all know now they werent afraid they werent even worried they were f cking pissed meanwhile the momentum guys and long side hfts keep gobbling up the generously donated shares that the short side are plowing into their ladder attack lots of hft duels going on as long side hfts try to intercept shares meant to travel between short side hft accounts for their ladder you can tell when you see prices like constantly flying across the tape retail cant even attempt to enter an order like that those are for the big boys with privileged low latency access the fact that you can even see that on the tape with human eyes is really bad for the short side people why you ask because it means liquidity is drying up and fast the liquidity tide is flowing out quickly whos naked short market technicals time i still wish this sub would allow pictures so i could throw up a chart but i guess a table will do fine date volume price at us market close friday monday tuesday wednesday thursday what do i see i see the shares available to trade dropping so fast that all the near exchange compute power in the world wont let the short side hfts maintain order flow volume for their attacks many retail people asking me questions thought today was the heaviest trading nope it was just the craziest what about the price dropping on thursday is that a sign that the short side pulled a miracle out and pushed price down against a parabolic move on even less volume than wednesday is the long side running out of capital nope it means the short side hedge funds are just about finished but wait i thought the price needed to be higher for them to be taken out how is it that price being lower is bad for them wont that allow them to cover at a lower price no the volume is so low that they cant cover any meaningful fraction of their position without spiking the price parabolic almost instantly just not enough shares on offer at reasonable prices especially when wsb keeps flashing you its true a higher price hurts but the interest charge for one more day is just noise at this point the only tick that will really count is the last tick of trading on friday in the meantime the price drop and watching the sparring in real time tells me that the long side whales and their hft quants are so certain of the squeeze that theyre no longer worried at all about whether it will happen and they arent even worried at all about retail morale to help carry the water anymore instead theyre now really really worried about how cheaply they can make it happen they are wondering if they cant edge out just a sliver more alpha out of what will already be a blow out trade for the history books probably you see to make it happen they just have to keep hoovering up shares it doesnt matter what those shares cost if youre certain that the squeeze is now locked in why push the price up and pay more than you have to just keep pressing hard enough to force short side to keep sending those tasty shares your way but not so much you move the price short side realizes this and doesnt try to drive price down too aggressively they cant afford to let price run away so they have to keep some pressure on at the lowest volume they can manage but they dont want to push down too hard and give the long side hfts too deep of a discount and bleed their ammo out even faster that dynamic keeps price within a narrow for gme today anyway trading range for the rest of the day into the close good plan guys but those after market people are pushing the price up again damnit wsb bros and euros youre costing those poor long side whales their extra of alpha on this trade just so you can run up your green rockets see thats the kind of nonsense that just validates lee coopermans concerns on a totally unrelated note i have to say that i appreciate the shift in cnbcs reporting much more thoughtful and informed just please get a good market technician in there who will be willing to talk about what is going on under the hood if possible a lot of people watching on the sidelines are far more terrified than they need to be because it all looks random to them and theyre worried that you guys look confused and worried and if the experts on the news are worried you should be able to find one who has access to the really good data that we retailers can only guess at who can explain it to us unwashed masses ok so questions there is no market justification for this how can you tell me is this fundamentally sound and not just straight throwing money away irresponsibly side note not that that should matter if you want to throw your money away why shouldnt you be allowed to were not trading in your securities pricing model this isnt irrational just because your model says long and short positions are the same thing the model is not a real market there is asymmetrical counterparty risk here given the shorts are on the hook for all the money they have and possibly all the money their brokers have and possibly anyone with exposure to the broker too you may want people to trade by the rules you want them to follow but the rest of us trade in the real market as it is actually implemented remember thats what you tell the retailers who take their accounts to zero remember what you told the kbio short squeezed people they had fair warning that short positions carry infinite risk including more than your initial investment you guys know this its literally part of your job to know this but but the systemic risk this is madness madness this is the market retail kicks the short side hedge funds down an infinity loss black hole ok seriously though that is actually a fundamentally sound and properly profit driven answer at least as justifiable as the hedge funds justification for going of float short if they can be allowed to gamble infinite losses because they expect to make profit on the possibility the company goes bankrupt cant others do the inverse on the possibility the company i dont know doesnt go bankrupt and gets a better strategy from the team that created what is now a market cap company chwy that does exactly some of the things gme needs to do digital revenue growth maybe i mean i first bought in on that fundamental value thesis in the and then upped my cost basis given the asymmetry of risk in the technical analysis as an obvious no brainer momentum trade the squeeze is just as wsb people might say tendies raining down from on high as an added bonus i get that you disagree on the fundamental viability of gme great isnt that what makes a market regarding the consequences of a squeeze in practice my expectation was maybe at worst some kind of ex market settlement after liquidation of the funds with exposure to keep things nice and orderly for the rest of the market i mean they handled the vw thing somehow right i see now that i just underestimated elite hedge fund managers though those guys are so hardcore ill explain why i think so a bit lower down if hedge fund people are so hardcore how did the retail long side ever have a chance of winning this squeeze trade theyre talking about because its an asymmetrical battle once you have short interest cornered and the risk is also crazily asymmetrical in favor of the long side if short interest is what it is in gme in fact the hedge funds essentially cornered themselves without anyone even doing anything they just dug themselves right in there kind of impressive really in a weird way what does the short side need to cover they need the price to be low and they need to buy shares how does price move lower you have to push share volume such that supply overwhelms demand and price therefore goes down man i knew econ would come in handy someday but wait if you have to sell shares to push the price down wont you just undo all your work when you have to buy it back to actually cover the trick is you have to push price down so hard so fast so unpredictably that you scare other people into selling their shares too because theyre scared of taking losses their sales help push the price down for free and then you scoop them up at discount price also there are ways to make people scared other than price movement and fear of losses when you get right down to it so you know you just need to get really really really good at making people scared remember to add a line item to your budget to make sure you can really do it right on the other hand what does the long side need to do they need to own as much of the shares as they can get their hands on and then they need to hold on to them they cant be weak hands either they need to be hands that will hold even under the most intense heat of battle and the immense pressure of mind numbing fear they need to be as if they were made of diamond oh wow maybe those wsb people kind of have a point here why does this matter because at some point the sell side will eventually run out of shares to borrow they simply wont be there because theyll be safely tucked away in the long sides accounts once you run out of shares to borrow and sell you have no way to move the price anymore you cant just drop a fat stack excuse me i mean suitcase were talking hedge fund money here after all of benjamins on the ticker tape directly only shares no more shares no way to have any direct effect on the price whatsoever ok doesnt that just mean trading stops cant you just out wait the long side then well you could until someone on the long side puts share up on a ask and an even crazier person actually buys at that price on the last tick on a friday lets just say it gets really bad at that point ok but how do the retail people actually get paid well to be quite honest its entirely up to each of them individually youve seen the volumes being thrown around the past week i guarantee you every single retailer out there could have printed money multiple times trading that flow if they choose to and time it well or they could lose it all this is the market some of them apparently seem to have some plan or an implicit trust in certain individuals to help them know when to punch out maybe it works out but maybe not there will be financial casualties on the field for sure this is the bare knuckled capitalist jungle after all remember but everyone ponied up to the table with their own money somehow so they all get to play in the big leagues just like everyone else in theory anyway and now probably the question ive been asked on all of these posts has been so what happens next do we get the infinity squeeze do the hedge funds go down great questions i dont know no one does thats what ive said every time but i get thats a frustrating answer so ill write a bit more and speculate further please again understand these are my opinions with a degree of speculation i wouldnt normally put in a post the market and the economy main street wall street and washington the pandemic has hurt so many people that its hard to comprehend honestly i dont even pretend to be able to i have been crazy fortunate enough to almost not be affected at all honestly it is a little unnerving to me how great the disconnect is between people who are doing fine or better than fine looking at my ira versus the people who are on the opposite side of the ever widening divide that lets be honest has been growing wider since long before the pandemic people on the other side who have been told they cannot work even if they want to who wonder if congress will get it together to at least keep them from getting thrown out of their house if they have to keep taking one for the team for the good of all are wondering if theyre even living in the same reality because all they see on the news each day is that the stock market is at record highs or some amazing tech stocks have d in the last months how can that be happening during a pandemic because the market is not the economy the market looks forward to that brighter future that economy types just need to wait for dont worry itll be here sometime before the end of the year we think were making money on that assumption right now anyway oh by the way if youre in the market you get to get richer as a minor unearned side effect of the solutions our governments have come up with to fight the pandemic wow that sounds amazing how do i get to part of that world retail fintech baby physical assets like real estate might be a bit out of reach at the moment but stocks will do i can even buy fractional shares of brk a lol finally i can trade for my own slice of heaven watching that balance go up and up go stonks now i too get to dream the dream i get to feel connected to that mythical world the market rather than being stuck in the plain old economy sure i might blow up my account but thats because its the jungle bare knuckled big league capitalism going on right here and at least i get to show up an put my shares on the table with everyone else at least im playing the same game everyone has to start somewhere at least now i get to start even if i have to learn my lesson by zeroing my account a few times ive basically had to deal with what felt like my life zeroing out a few times before this is number on a screen going to is nothing laugh or cry right ill post my losses on wsb and at least get some laughs geez some of the people here are making bank i better learn from them and see if theyll let me in on their trades wow this actually might work i dont understand yet but i trust these guys telling me to hold onto this crazy trade i dont understand it but all the memes say its going to be big wow i can pay off my credit card with this number do i punch out now no hold ok getting nervous watching the number go down but i trust you freaks were still in the jungle but at least im in with with my posse now market open tomorrow we ride the rocket baby and if it goes down at least im going down with my crew at least if that happens the memes will be so hilarious ill forget to cry wow i cant believe it we might actually pull this off laugh at us now pros were in the market now and market rules tell us what is going to happen were getting all that hedge fund money right right maybe first i say maybe because nothing is ever guaranteed until it clears secondly because the rules of the market are not as perfectly enforced as we would like to assume we are also finding out they may not be perfectly fair the market most experts are willing to talk about is really more like the ideal the market is supposed to be this is the version of the market i make my trading decisions in however the real market gets strange and unpredictable at the edges when things are taken to extremes or rules are pushed beyond the breaking point or some of the mechanics deep in the guts of the real market get stretched gme ticks basically all of those boxes which is why so many people are getting nervous aside from the crazy money they might lose its also important to remember that the sheer amount of money flowing through the market has distorting power unto itself because its money and people really really really like their money especially when theyre used to having a lot of it and rules involving that kind of money tend to look more flexible shall we say ok back to gme if this situation with gme is allowed to play out to its conclusion in the market well see what happens i think all the long side people get the chance to be paid what im not sure and remember you have to actually sell your position at some point or its all still just numbers on your screen but no one knows for certain but this might legitimately get so big that it spills out of the market and back into the economy geez and here i thought the point of all of this was so that we all get to make so much money we wouldnt ever have to think and worry about that thing again unfortunately while hes kind of a buzzkill thomas petterfy has a point this could be a serious problem it might blow out the market which will definitely crap on the economy which as we all know from hard experience will seriously crush main street if its that big a deal we may even need washington to be involved once that happens who knows what to expect this kind of scenario being possible is why ive been saying i have no idea how this ends and no one else does either how did we end up in this ridiculous situation from gamestop and its not retails fault the situation is what it is why is everyone telling us that we need to back down to save the market what about the short side hedge funds that slammed that risk into the system to begin with were just playing by the rules of the market well here are my thoughts opinions and some even further speculation this may be total fantasy land stuff here but since i keep getting asked ill share anyway just keep that disclaimer in mind a study in big finance power moves if you owe the bank its your problem what happens when you owe money you have no way to pay back its a scary question to have to face personally still on balance and on average if youre fortunate enough to have access to credit the borrowing is a risk that is worth taking especially if youre reasonably careful lenders can take a risk loaning you money you take a risk by borrowing in order to do something now that you would otherwise have had to wait a long time or maybe would never have realistically been able to do otherwise sometimes it doesnt work out sometimes its due to reasons totally beyond your control in any case if you find yourself there you have no choice but to dust yourself off pick yourself up as best as you can and try to move on and rebuild a lot of people had to learn that in man that year really sucked wall street learned their lessons too most learned what i think most of us would consider the right lessons lessons about risk management and the need to guard vigilantly against systemic risk concentration of risk through excess concentration of leverage on common assets etc many suspect that at least a few others may have learned an entirely different set of shall we say unhealthy lessons also to try to be completely fair maybe managing other peoples money on leverage comes with a kind of pressure that just clouds your judgement i could actually genuinely buy that i know i make mistakes under pressure even when im trading risk capital i could totally lose with no real consequence whatever the motive heres my read on whats happening first remember that as much fun as wsb are making of the short side hedge fund guys right now those guys are smart scary smart keep that in mind next lets put ourselves in their shoes if youre a high alpha hedge fund manager slinging trades on a leveraged to portfolio get caught in a bad situation and are down mark to market several hundred million what do you do do you take your losses and try again next time hell no youre elite you dont realize losses you double down you can still save this trade no sweat but what if that doesnt work out so well and youre in the hole obvious double down need you ask im net up on the rest of my positions of course and the momentum when this thing makes its mean reversion move will be so hot you can almost taste the alpha from here speaking of momentum imagine the move if your friends on tv start hyping the story harder genius ok so that still didnt work this is now a frigging sigma departure from your modeled risk and youre now locked into a situation that is about as close to mathematically impossible to escape as you can get in the real world and quickly converging on infinite downside holy crap the fund might be liquidated by your prime broker by tomorrow morning and man even the broker is freaking out fin elon musk and his twitter youre cancelling your advance booking on his rocket ship to mars first thing tomorrow ok focus this might legit impact your total annual return you need a plan and you know the smartest people on the planet right the masters of the universe awesome theyve even seen this kind of thing before and still have the playbook of course its obvious now you borrow a few more billion and double down again first thing in the morning so simple sticky note that mars trip cancellation so you dont forget ok so that didnt work you even cashed in some pretty heavy chits too ah well that was a long shot anyway so where were you oh yeah if shenanigans dont work skip to page which says of course to double down again anyone even keeping track anymore oh says its and were going parabolic man that chart gives me goosebumps all according to plan so what happens tomorrow one possible outcome of pure fantastic speculation end of the week phew never though itd come where are you at now over wow you did it boys and as a bonus the memes will be so sweet side note add zeros to the end awesome your problems have been solved because boom now its everyones problem come at me chamath this is real baller shit now all you gotta do is make all the hysterical retirees watching their iras hanging in the balance blame those wsb kids hahaha boomers amirite hate when those kids step on their law i mean iras gg guys keep you memes that is how its done ok but seriously i hope thats not how it ends i guess we just take it day by day at this point apologies for the length good luck in the market also apologies in advance for formatting spelling and grammatical errors i was typing this thing in between doing all kinds of other things for most of the day edit getting a bunch of questions on if its possible the hedge funds are finding ways to cover in spite of my assumptions of course

211,the course gives a broad overview of introductory finance that most here will obviously already know the first reason i thought it worth sharing is because the teacher andrew lo is probably the best and most passionate finance professor ive ever seen really hooks you into the lectures the second is that the course is filmed during the height of the subprime crisis and each lecture starts with a discussion of recent events and how they relate to concepts in the course very interesting to hear perspectives and how they progress throughout the crisis lecture series for those of you that want a great discussion explanation about what caused the mispricing of subprime mortgages as opposed to the superficial one given in the big short i would recommend the following section from lecture fixed income securities iv,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,investing

214,disclaimer i am not a financial advisor this entire post represents my personal views and opinions and should not be taken as financial advice or advice of any kind whatsoever i encourage you to do your own research take anything i write with a grain of salt and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch also full disclosure i hold a net long position in gme but my cost basis is very low and im using money i can absolutely lose my capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours rather than doing a writeup of friday i think the time i have at the moment would be better spent going over some conceptual market mechanics as i mentioned in my previous post that covered some light analysis of the week my first glance was that friday was a low conviction low volume day where momentum traders and volatility arbitraging hft algos were skirmishing and a slightly deeper look tells me thats probably the case for almost the entire day up to the last minutes before close there was a bit of a push toward the end of the day just to extract maximum interest charge pain keep in mind also that on friday many of the retail brokerages still had issues with gme and gme price was also protected from aggressive short side attack due to the uptick rule capital flow liquid float and price ok so lets go with a diagram i put together while thinking about how to best answer a ton of questions related to the mechanics behind triggering a squeeze this is not very formal just conceptual to help you think about the relationship between price liquid free float and capital required to move things around capital flow to price volatility leverage conceptual diagram as you can see in the diagram i figured it would be conceptually clearest to model the relationship kind of like a seesaw on the left you can see that people selling tends to increase liquid float moving the fulcrum of our conceptual seesaw to the right except in the case of selling to people who are planning to buy and hold which moves the fulcrum to the left the lower the liquid free float or the further to the left the fulcrum goes the greater the likely impact of any particular capital flow net selling or buying on share price importantly as the diagrams on the right half show its not a linear relationship the closer the liquid free float comes to the faster the price volatility increases theoretically approaching infinity as liquid free float approaches i find it sometimes help to think of the extreme case to help clarify on the extremely liquid side if you have all of the tens of millions of gme shares in play dropping in to buy shares probably doesnt even register on the ticker on the other extreme if what if there was only share in play that same instantly prices gme at a share if you can even get the person holding it to sell since company value is estimated mark to market gme would instantly become rated one of the most if not the most valuable companies in the world this is in no way true of course as you could not subsequently sell all the rest of the shares at that price but as far as a whole bunch of market mechanics and market participants are concerned they would have to treat it that way until another transaction took place to re price the company so in the grand scheme of things in terms of difficulty of initiating what magnitude of a squeeze the primary factor is locking up actively traded liquid free float also important to keep in mind locking up the float is only very gradually noticeable until you get very close to locking it all down and you reach a point where suddenly each fraction of free float being locked up has parabolically greater impact on price volatility reaching its limit where going from actively traded shares to actively traded share doubles price volatility sensitivity to capital flow by just locking up a single additional share so simple right actually yes however dont mistake simple for easy absolutely not the same thing in this case market games so gme and other high short interest stocks are looked at in two ways by many market participants on the one hand you have normal investors and traders who dont really pay attention to it at all and if they do they see it as a tool for price discovery that is otherwise neutral and dampens volatility people tend to short stocks as price goes up and cover shorts as price drops so normal shorting activity is at least in theory supposed to help keep price stable then you have what ill call market gamers these are people who are willing to look through the veil of what various mechanics in the market are theoretically intended to accomplish and just pay attention to what they actually do there are a number of market mechanics that get really strange in extreme circumstance and shorting is one of them as using it to the extreme can absolutely crush a companys share price and actually harm the company badly the counter to that is the increasing risk of a squeeze which gets worse with extreme price volatility imagine it this way short interest in a stock is like the stock comes with a very strange feature a closed wormhole portal into the brokerage account of the short position holder that if slammed with a high enough day or week end price blows open and sucks their account capital through and possibly their brokers capital too until theyve patched it closed again with shares of stock they were short thats not how youre supposed to look at it but thats kind of how it actually works in practice most wall street types would find it appalling and wrong to think about it that way but with millenials and younger jumping in to the market were talking about generations of people who grew up watching things like people doing minute speed runs through games intended to take hrs to complete using nothing but the mechanics of the game in ways entirely unintended by the developers thats kind of what gme is like from a certain point of view a speed run through the market blitzing and confusing everyone watching throwing a ton of money at hedge funds short interest until you blow a hole in their account and suck the capital out with the force of a black hole of course people are getting jumpy battleground strategy and tactics in a way gme has turned into a battleground stock in the minds of many wall street people wall street vs wsb is basically the way its been depicted in the media and a number of them seem to be taking it personally with a battleground stock i find it helpful to think of it like a literal battleground but with territory marked out by stock price it helps you consider the impact on each side what their motives are and tactical and strategic implications the reason i think this way is that once a stock becomes a battleground the issue is no longer about price discovery its about proving a point or accomplishing a specific goal which changes the dynamics of the trade in my opinion the retail strength defensive line is at the level as mentioned in my previous post analyzing the week this is based on the majority of volume being in the runup from to which triggered the first squeeze my guess is short side strength hardens at the level based on that being the level at which the whale plugged the first squeeze what this means is that you can expect some short side people to actively short more at that level possibly following through on momentum as many of them want to prove a point that gme is a stock as stated by a number of them on cnbc might seem like a low number given fridays close but remember that friday trading was subject to the uptick rule so the short effectively could not push back and was instead fighting a rearguard action to bleed the long side advance as much as possible and lure them off their strength as much as possible say what is there a point to those analogies like that why yes of course because those analogies are very good mental models for what is going to happen in a short squeeze campaign remember in the grand scheme of things the goal of the long side is first and foremost to lock up liquid float that means buying and holding shares the question is how much will it cost you to move the needle on that so to speak the higher the price the short side can force you to pay to lock up float the longer itll take and the more expensive it will be it is also like fighting far from your supply lines in that respect in that there will be weaker hands mixed in far beyond hard support levels such that quick pushes by the short side will shake them out loosening float back up how about on the long side you want the short side to overextend themselves by shorting the price down on momentum and hopefully get them to keep building up short interest at the lowest price at which they will do so this means having to have the patience to see the price go as low as you can tolerate before you start losing your key support to despair why because it means youre buying the shares they throw at you at a lower price costs less to move the needle on locking up liquid free float and also that their short position is at a lower average price lowering the price it will take to trigger a squeeze the above is why in some cases you will see a sharp dip before the vertical move in a squeeze you can essentially lure the short side into an ambush by falling back to lower and lower price points which allows you to continue to lock up free float at ever cheaper prices while the short side thinks it is winning once you think youve accumulated enough to prevent covering without a parabolic price move you spike the price back the other way and its effectively game over it can take some time to play out to its conclusion but that is the essence of it lets make it concrete and put some numbers to it lets say you need to lock up more shares for the squeeze no idea just using the number for easy math if you can buy it all skirmishing at the line youll pay to do it if instead youve extended to the line youre going to pay if youre an alpha seeking whale why pay more to accomplish the same thing if you can get away with it if you recall i referenced seeing what i thought looked like this type of ticker behavior in my post that being said you might not mess around with those types of tactics at this point if you think youre already close to blowing up the next short interest holder if you think youre close then youre looking at the most efficient way to make the last tick at trading close as high as possible that is very similar to the price action we saw on friday at the end of the day as mentioned earlier if you think about it if the goal is the have the price at above a certain point at the end of the day what is more efficient rush in the morning then have to pay that higher price level for the whole day to maintain it or wait until later in the day as late as you think you can manage and then push to that point at the very last tick that at least is a very high level view of what youre trying to accomplish but it gets very complicated in the details if youre dueling with a good hft algorithm you can run into things like the price getting spiked to trigger halts to run out the clock kind of like fouling someone in basketball which gets harder in the final minutes of trading due to the wider lu ld allowances but still doable even if you have to do it by sucking price level up maybe to give you mins to call your buddy at blackrock to dump shares onto the ticker or something like that another thing to keep in mind one of the reasons these things can roll on for a long time is it might not be a one and done blowout possibly on purpose think about it if you can get people to keep piling short interest in particularly for emotional reasons you can ring the register as many times as they are willing to keep doing it to ultimately prove their point think of the citron guy who re shorted back in around what or i think all because he wanted to make his point when he got blown out at the move off of there are people piling back in right now who knows how many times theyre willing to reload the short float ok so this post is much longer than i originally intended anyway but i think the diagram and some of the descriptions above should provide a good amount of food for thought and discussion a number of people asked me why i said that price to squeeze was secondary at this point if you havent already figured out why try to think about it or maybe ask in comments and someone can help with a further discussion a couple of final points assuming the long side people continue to lock up liquid float remember that volatility can get greater in both directions this can mean that you get wiped out if youre somehow still trading gme on margin as a quick price collapse can get you margin called even if the price quickly rebounds later greater volatility means you should mentally prepare for big dips as well as swings to the upside pre market and after hours trading dont have circuit breakers so it could get wild during those times too also with extreme volatility you end up possibly hitting halts more frequently after the first frustrating day of this happening with gme i made myself a basic thinkorswim thinkscript study so id have a handy reference on whether it looked like this was going to happen for those of you on tos use it on the minute chart note that the luld tolerances are different in first few minutes and toward the end of the day so youd have to adjust the parameters or just keep it in mind i use it with the step lines vs the default line if price crosses the guard lines then youre getting close if it crosses the circuit breaker line then youre about to be or already are getting halted here is the code input trailingperiodlength input circuitbreakerpercent input guardmultiplepercent def trlavg average

224,what is going on there are more shares of gme shorted than actually exist that means that if the stock goes up for any reason short sellers come under pressure to buy shares to close their short positions but when the first short seller cracks and buys shares taking a loss they inadvertently drive the price up further adding to the pressure on the other short sellers soon its a race to buy shares but there simply arent enough to go around so the price skyrockets before falling back down as shareholders finally take profits and sell this is called a short squeeze the only way a short squeeze is averted is if the stock price drops for some reason like bad news from the company gme is at ath right now so its very unlikely that the short sellers will get out alive its a matter of when they start to crack not if by all accounts they havent cracked yet so the short squeeze hasnt actually started what happened friday was a gamma squeeze which is unrelated to a short squeeze but happens when call options are being bought extremely fast and the stock price is rising which indirectly causes market makers to buy massive volumes of shares to hedge driving the price higher and so on the high probability of a massive short squeeze caused retail traders to plow money into shares and calls on friday which in then caused a gamma squeeze causing the stock price to go higher making the short squeeze even more likely if you have gambling money and you want to take part in this unique event you either buy shares or call options shares are safer since no matter when the squeeze occurs youre ready while calls expire but calls give you leverage calls even far otm and short expiry calls are likely to be very expensive everybody knows this is going down its been covered on major news and retail money is flooding in as people try to get onboard before the shorts crack edit either pony up for gold so i dont have to look at ads or save your money for gme shares monday morning,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,investing
225,disclaimer i am not a financial advisor this entire post represents my personal views and opinions and should not be taken as financial advice or advice of any kind whatsoever i encourage you to do your own research take anything i write with a grain of salt and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch also full disclosure i hold a net long position in gme but my cost basis is very low and im using money i can absolutely lose my capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours wow what a week all ill say on that for now ill maybe do a recap of friday at some point this weekend if i can for this post rather than a narrative recap ill go into some very light technical analysis on a couple of screenshots from td ameritrade thinkorswim and ortex i dont have a lot of time to go very deep into everything i normally do but i wanted to give the newer traders an example of how i go about coming to some of my conclusions some of the conclusions i came to in the heat of the moment in my previous posts may also not stand up to more rigorous scrutiny of the data in my opinion at least its very important to ensure that you go back and review any of your high conviction trades from time to time please feel free to use the charts ill show to challenge some of the assumptions i may have made and written about while watching the live ticker tape action social media and other high frequency sentiment indicators things i might rely on for a hyper realtime momentum monster trade like gme has been this past week maybe use them to challenge your own thoughts and assumptions as well i realized while doing this that writing those prior articles probably cost me in momentum trade opportunity lol since i used all of my free non trading hour time to write instead of do an even more in depth version of what im going to show you now that being said if that writing helped any of you understand what was going on and ultimately progress on your way to becoming better traders and investors that to me is well worth it maybe one day you too can pay it forward if any of you reading this are chart jockeys please share some tips if you have them first the charts links since pics arent allowed on this sub ortex short interest data daily summary of the week mini squeeze hourly to fibonacci retracement fundamentals ortex short interest first lots of questions on the prior post about short interest remaining on gme so ill start with this one looks good to me i think ortex will update end of trading friday data just before around monday market open i consider this chart to convey mostly fundamental data as the underlying value thesis behind the recent push by retail traders has at least recently been about the squeeze this is the type of data youd use to try to analyze data about the security being traded note that most pro traders would not consider short interest to be a fundamental attribute and normally id agree but i think gme and maybe some of the other high si plays are an exception to that if any of you are inclined to feel jumpy about the diving lines on the chart make sure to look at the axis values on the left the chart is calibrated to capture the movement over the period so the bottom of the axes are not a few things to note short interest drops substantially from into volume is shrinking remaining free float on loan has gone down but at as of thursday is still quite high overview daily chart summary of the week a few things going on here the big volume days on friday monday and tuesday are when it seems to me that the greatest retail momentum would have occurred the battles were pretty intense at key price points if you take a closer look at those intra day charts big picture here what it tells me is that many if not most of the retail share volume was acquired at or below on huge volume that means the core of your retail support and the majority of shares in wsb diamond hands would have been bought probably between the and price range my guess is that only dfv the dfv early acolytes dr burry and the institutional holders have meaningful volume below given points and id consider the price level as the critical defense level of your earliest hardest retail support you can dive deeper into the trading day and possibly make a case for other levels as well but ill roll with that for now ok so maybe the melvin guys werent really lying the ortex data showing short interest drop from to coinciding with the massive and sudden price dislocation upward on if new shorts entered the game it would have been near the highs possibly selling into the forced buying of what ill just assume was the overnight melvin squeeze and into the early market hours on possibly aggressive momentum shorting on top of the robin hood bs the bots and the networking issues came together in a perfect storm with that hft ladder attack on the vertical dive wow no wonder that thing was so intense as you can see on that downside wick on the huge momentum briefly pierced the retail line before being slammed back up well take a closer look in the fibonacci chart analysis mini squeeze hourly just a few notes i checked and the after hours volume here was sudden quite unusual and pretty consistent with a forced liquidation of a substantial position rather than slamming it all out at once the broker spread it out quite a bit some takeaways if you wanted to take money from melvin this was the chance and a lot of people or a few whales certainly did the numbers in my summary were very quick mental math of the hourly volumes in overnight trading the price didnt break away as aggressively as it probably could have which means there was some carefully calibrated pre planning to unload a bunch of shares laddering up to the level i am genuinely sorry to have to conclude therefore that the wsb bros with the limit got scooped something on the order of million shares worth of melvin dollars got cashed out under them by a hft whale with access to firehose shares at melvins broker all the way through overnight trading few retail even have the ability to trade for that entire window and certainly not on the order of million shares anyway another important takeaway million shares is a lot but its nowhere near the entire original si in gme the game hasnt necessarily stopped yet heh technical analysis to fibonacci retracement for those of you who are unfamiliar with what traders call technical analysis its really just a fancy set of words to say looking at squiggly lines bars etc on charts to try to figure out whats going on one particularly popular tool is called a fibonacci retracement it sounds a lot fancier than it is but it is extremely useful and extremely commonly used by momentum traders which is partly why its useful if everyone is trading off of the same thing its a self reinforcing bias in the market there is a lot of background reading you can do on the topic i recommend it youll be a better trader and even investor for it as it tends to be useful even on longer timeframe charts kind of uncanny really looking at this chart i realize i probably should have plotted the retail line of defense here too oh well maybe next time takeaways i figured the relevant trading range going forward was peak euphoria to peak despair in regular trading on relatively good volume that happened to be the top to bottom move on the robin hood news using that for the fibonacci retracement you can see how much of the trading action bounces around between the various levels before settling in scarily accurately into the channel in after hours trading its quite possible that short term equilibrium on this battleground stock is to until either side makes a strong push price was trapped in that range toward the end of normal trading on relatively good volume probably a bunch of momentum traders drew exactly this retracement or something very similar for their rest of day trading after the floor got put in near the retail line of defense in all honesty its hard to say if the tool works because of some fundamental reason or because everyone uses it so everyone times their momentum plays off the same playbook making it self reinforcing all that matters in the end is that it works pretty consistently once you get used to working with it below the price graph pay attention to the volume bars below its especially critical when trading momentum to understand the relationship between share volume and price as there are patterns that are more likely to play out depending on the relationship for example when price is moving around a lot is it doing so on high volume or not much volume traders tend to overshoot a little on each push so even if price ultimately drops lower after an upside spike if the volume on that drop is low compared to the upward push that actually tells you that its likely to go higher a little later on there are many sites that go more in depth into this kind of thing patterns volume and price analysis etc and it is incredibly useful to try to understand what to take away from price and volume movement as you watch it unfold live lots more going on here but this post is getting pretty long already other takeaways the whales in the pond obviously do their homework thats how they got to be that big after all and they were therefore prepared to act decisively to unload million shares at the upper end of the trading range when melvin got blown up thats how you make big bank on big volume do your homework my thesis in the part article that the big early drop before retail pre market was a short side scare tactic could very well be totally wrong you could make a case either way that it was a new short side player diving in at a higher price point a long side whale making bank or a combo of both if you check the ortex data against the numbers here you can probably come up with an order of magnitude educated estimate if so apologies to the cnbc squawk box crew probably no factual inaccuracies in your reporting though the tone did make a lot of retail panic ironically it might very well have been the continued unwinding of melvins short position that intercepted the panic drop into premarket rather than a long side heavy hitter lol thursday afternoon and friday were low volume low conviction momentum sloshing around dueling hft algos and momentum traders trying to scalp alpha from each other is my guess contract expiration may cause a price dislocation into the new trading week so im not sure the fibonacci retracement chart is still useful im sure if i go back over my previous articles and compare to the chart data more carefully ill find all kinds of other inconsistencies with my realtime thoughts its key when trading at least in my opinion that you are willing able and indeed eager to go back and rethink your assumptions no matter how much you liked them challenge and verify with data whenever possible not doing that is how melvin got blown up after all my worst case scenario thesis in the part article may still be valid depending on the total amount of short interest loading up into gme at these newer highs i remember hearing some fund manager talking about shorting gme at the as a stabilization mechanism wow short something with the most hyper volatility of any stock ive ever heard of for stability thats not a word id ever associate with a wsb meme momentum rollercoaster stock an infinity squeeze is still totally on the table as long as sufficient short interest remains the strategy and tactics youd use to get there may have to be different though as price ratchets up into higher bands ill keep those thoughts to myself for sure those wsb guys have a plan theyve proven to be scary effective so far after all there are other things you can take away or theses you can come up with from these and other charts you may have access to hopefully for you newer traders ive given you a useful glimpse into how i might try to use readily available data to improve challenge refine a working thesis to ensure im better prepared for the days ahead you should find the tools that seem to work best for you hope you all have a good weekend see you on the field on monday,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,investing

230,disclaimer i am not a financial advisor this entire post represents my personal views and opinions and should not be taken as financial advice or advice of any kind whatsoever i encourage you to do your own research take anything i write with a grain of salt and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch there are numerous posts on this sub and others diving into the technical guts behind some of the recent moves behind gme so i will keep it high level for everyone scratching their heads wondering whats going on there has been much talk on cnbc and in other financial media calling whats happening in gme a distortion of the market and an unjustifiable departure from the fundamentals that is undeniably true that being said the distortion is not whats playing out now but rather what happened about years ago when short interest in gme first began to approach and later exceed of the available float short selling is usually a tool that aids in price discovery but like most market mechanisms at the extremes things get more complicated short sellers having borrowed shares are guaranteed indeed obligated future buyers of the stock they put themselves in that position on the thesis that there are reasons to expect the stock price to go down such that when they buy the shares back they can return what they borrowed at a lower price and pocket the difference as such as short interest grows there is a short term downard push on the price the initial sale of the borrowed shares but also future upside pull on the stock price as a natural result kind of like gravity but pulling the price upward normally that pressure is so slight and subtle that short interest in and of itself should not be a mover of the stock price that being said a common rule of thumb is that you should start to concern yourself with that pressure when short interest crosses the threshold of between and of the effective float shares actually available to trade at that level and above the pressure starts to become noticeable kind of like the moon causing currents and tides gme short interest was recently of the float in recent days short interest has actually continued to accumulate ill explain why later there is in effect a critical mass of short interest hanging over gmes price exerting not subtle pull but face ripping force like the gravity of a black hole a short singularity if you will previous short squeeze case studies such as vw or kbio were all about someone engineering a way for effective float to evaporate suddenly leaving what was previously a relatively reasonable aggregate short interest position in a world of hurt this is the first time where were seeing a situation play out where it wasnt someone engineering a shrinkage of effective float but large market moving players simply blowing up the short interest to the point where it simply overtook effective float by a large margin why would they do that because they expected gme to declare bankruptcy in the very near term so that returning borrowed shares costs as the shares are worthless at that point also an arguably intentional side effect of this massive artificial sell side pressure on the stock is that it becomes more difficult for gme to obtain any kind of financing to avoid bankruptcy making it in theory a self fulfilling prophecy gme however did not go bankrupt for reasons that are well explained by other posters in order to close their positions and limit their exposure which remains theoretically infinite otherwise short interest holders need to collectively buy back more shares than are available on the market and especially since gme is no longer at risk of imminent bankruptcy that buying action would push the price into a parabolic upward move likely forcing brokers to liquidate short interest holding accounts across the board on the way to buy shares at any price to cover their otherwise infinite liability exposure and that forced covering will push the price further upward into a feedback loop like crossing the event horizon of the black hole in our analogy so what is happening now and where do we go from here right now short side interests are desperately trying to drive the price down there has been an across the board media blitz to try to scare investors away from gme but there is really only one way to drive price down directly and that is selling in fact given that most of the large holders of gme long positions are simply sitting on their shares it means selling even more shares short even as price has been grinding upward and liquidity has been evaporating short sellers who have lost billions mark to market currently my guess is on the order of by the end of trading today can only keep selling piling on even more exposure and losses staving off oblivion hour by hour minute by minute gme might also decide to issue more shares to recapitalize its business on the back of the elevated share price but it is unlikely they could issue enough shares to change the overall trajectory of the stock at this point especially not given their fiduciary responsibility to current stock holders it might however run the clock out a little while longer at this point it looks like there will either be some type of external market intervention by regulators though i cant see any reason for them to step in myself or we will soon see what happens when short positions representing in current mark to market liability goes parabolic edited for grammar edit please keep discussion to helping everyone understand whats happening which is

236,s p since crashes hi guys just wanted to put things in perspective for you all since some of you seem to be quite nervous with the recent week of stock movement ive summarised a list all stock market crashes since there has been stock market crashes since averaging one every years the stock market crashes ranges from inflation to oil price rises due to war dot com bubble housing market collapse covid etc the graph is a log graph meaning that the space changes are proportional to the percentage change this is useful for looking at long term charts since the change for a dollar increase is smaller as the index value goes up the s p has averaged a compound annual growth rate of since this is illustrated by the trend lines and as you can see the s p is trading right in the middle of the range the two blue trend lines i noted a few reasons in the box for each crash for a brief understanding of why it had happened note that the only one with a fear of overvaluation was only the dotcom crash where the pes were over and many companies were just cash burning shells with massive negative free cash flows im not saying a crash correction wont happen but i just wanted to put things into perspective and give a bigger picture of the overall stock market since pretty much before all of us were born by no means am i an economist but i didnt include anything earlier than because that was pre before the us was a superpower the global financial hub usd world trade currency etc edit some of you noted that its only if you bought at the start but i want to clarify that yes and no yes for the people that literally buy in once once at the beginning of no because if you buy throughout the years dca every month lets say youll buy within the range both lower and higher range so its more or less for example during the traded sideways so if you constantly bought in those years the accumulation of money in this period would have a higher cagr of because of where it is in the range just follow the lines it makes it easier theres roughly same amount of periods above and below the middle trend line edit changed enron scandal to lehman brothers as some pointed out my mistake edit further log graph explanation why log is preferred if the scale has a large range i e to then log should be used because its important to show the changes as opposed to the point changes a point increase in the now is only whereas a point increase years ago was its important to look at it in terms of change because companies grow in terms of as well for example you dont quote apple has grown its business by billion this year random number instead you say apple grew its sales by this year its so that its comparable,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,investing
237,whats up everyone i created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due diligence or discussion styled posts instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment i logged how popular the post was among the sub reddit essentially if it makes it to the hot page then it will most likely be on this list there are two parts to this post the first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub reddits such as this one and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the wsb sub reddit how can i use this list the best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending as an example i probably would have never known about the ark etfs or even palantir until they started trending on reddit this gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not the data on this list is limited to one post per ticker ive taken the most popular post for that ticker on whichever sub reddit it may have been what ive found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub reddit then generally speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub reddits heres the data from the last week title tickers avg hype gme dd one dd to rule them one dd to find them one dd to to bring them all and in the darkness bind them people on robinhood who own gme are most likely to also own bb and pltr in their portfolio gme bitcoin plunge has newbies scrambling to google double spend jack ma emerges for first time since ant alibaba crackdown baba hk in hong kong is up if youre young with a high risk tolerance is there a better etf than arkk its time to short facebook amazon prime member total reaches million in u s with more shoppers opting in for a full year data shows amd undervalued at nio price target raised to by jpmorgan apple stock is a strong buy before earnings what do you think paypal becomes first foreign firm in china with full ownership of payments business i draw with crayons so you dont have to the grind up continues tickers on the watchlist this week crsr apps pins dkng snow apps crsr pins snow continuing our investing journey from pltr to dtil pltr is blackberry bb actually undervalued disney dis stock price target prediction analysis technical fundamental dcf can disney plug will soar way beyond the current price point this year biden didnt talk about clean energy in his stimulus plan clean energy stocks down a lot icln tan qcln is th tan qcln vale possible play on the topic of insider trading heres stock trading by us senators alongside spy the big negative bar is when a couple got caught doing what do you guys think of investing in xom pltr the big ddd microsoft betting on gm driverless tech msft cathie added share of pltr to arkw today you know what that means pltr airbnbs market cap is now bigger than the combined market caps of marriott hilton mgm and wynn resorts wynn biden to cancel keystone xl pipeline permit on first day in office cbc urgent tesla call advice remember when citron research was bullish on luckin lk and it turned out to be one of the biggest accounting security frauds in recent hi buying calls with high iv cciv is nokia a good long term buy current market price is amc entertainment ceo is shockingly close to staving off bankruptcy we remain long gme i reupped at after called in sick charts my whale friends position he bought more in the me and after dropping srpt shares show consistent increase following cathies arkg interest arkg arkg selling puts why did square inc sq increase so dramatically msft catching up crsr put sellers what is your plan tiktok finally beat fb in monthly time spent on the platform per user previous fvrr post made me try fiverr it was a clown show long term investing why not go with upro instead of spy since it the returns spy wsb most mentioned tickers this week total comments parsed last day s comment volume on gme was lower than usual because they had a separate thread specifically for gme ticker comments bullish gme gamestop corpor bb blackberry ltd tsla tesla inc pltr palantir techno aapl apple inc icln blackrock insti amd advanced micro baba alibaba group h amzn amazon com inc plug plug power inc f ford motor co nflx netflix inc nio nio inc adr fb facebook inc intc intel corp tlry tilray inc cl wish contextlogic in apha aphria inc nok nokia corp ad crsr corsair gaming amc amc entertainme msft microsoft corpo gld ssga active tru arkg ark investment arkk ark investment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,investing
238,joe biden has signed an executive order that bans american entities from investing in dozens of chinese companies with alleged ties to defense or surveillance technology sectors in a move that his administration says will expand the scope of a legally flawed trump era order the us treasury will enforce and update on a rolling basis the new ban list of about companies it also bars buying or selling publicly traded securities in target companies and replaces an earlier list from the defense department senior administration officials told reporters chips with everything how one taiwanese company drives the world economy read more the order prevents us investment from supporting the chinese military industrial complex as well as military intelligence and security research and development programs biden said in the order in addition i find that the use of chinese surveillance technology outside china and the development or use of chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats biden said a white house fact sheet on the order said the policy would take effect for those companies listed on august major chinese firms included on the previous defense department list were also placed on the updated list including aviation industry corp of china avic china mobile communications group china national offshore oil corp cnooc hangzhou hikvision digital technology huawei technologies and semiconductor manufacturing international corp smic smic is key to chinas national drive to boost its domestic chip sector we fully expect that in the months ahead well be adding additional companies to the new executive orders restrictions one of the senior officials said a second official told reporters that the inclusion of chinese surveillance technology companies expanded the scope of the trump administrations initial order last year which the white house argues was carelessly drafted leaving it open to court challenges the president has been reviewing a number of aspects of us policy toward china and his administration had extended a deadline for implementation set by donald trumps order while it crafted its new policy framework apple uses more suppliers from china than taiwan for first time data shows read more the move is part of bidens broader series of steps to counter china including reinforcing us alliances and pursuing large domestic investments to bolster american economic competitiveness amid increasingly sour relations between the worlds two most powerful countries bidens indo pacific policy coordinator kurt campbell said last month that a period of engagement with china had come to an end and that the dominant paradigm in bilateral ties going forward would be one of competition senior officials said the treasury would give guidance later on what the scope of surveillance technology means including whether companies are facilitating repression or serious human rights abuses we really want to make sure that any future prohibitions are on legally solid ground so our first listings really reflect that a second senior administration official said advertisement investors would have time to unwind investments a third official said the new list provided few surprises for investors looking to see if they need to unload even more chinese stocks and bonds but some previously identified companies such as commercial aircraft corp of china comac which is spearheading chinese efforts to compete with boeing and airbus as well as two companies that had challenged the ban in court gowin semiconductor corp and luokung technology corp were not included in may a judge signed an order removing the designation on chinese mobile phone maker xiaomi which was among the more high profile chinese technology companies that the trump administration targeted for alleged ties to chinas military,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,investing

241,ive been doing a lot of etf research lately and wanted to share this list because i think that smaller etfs fly under the radar all too often here are etfs with less than a billion dollars under management but that i think are interesting and possibly useful with reasons why thnq robo global artificial intelligence etf the process based management of thnqs holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning my only issue with it is that for some reason they dont include facebook in its holdings and fb is famous with pytorch and related work competitors in this thematic space include global xs aiq and ishares irbo a newer etf thnq has performed very very well since inception easily beating many other growth etfs certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade sfy sofi select etf this etf is highly intriguing it has a expense ratio yes free waived until at least end of june at which point it might go up to theyre waiving the fee to draw in aum its performance over the past trading year is so it beats the s p easily what they do is take the top us stocks by market cap then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology not market cap weighted which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit the etf ends up with more weighted overlap with the s p than other large cap growth etfs such as vug iwz jke etc because the value companies are still in there theyre just not weighted as highly as they are in spy or voo the usual suspects are still in the top aapl amzn msft tsla googl fb sq comes in at which i think is very nice and sq is missing from an s p etf granted if the er wasnt this etf would be significantly less attractive index methodology here dstl distillate u s fundamental stability value etf its methodology is in the prospectus essentially they try to combine quality and value factor investing the funds weighted overlap with spy is only according to etfrc com so its not simply the s p its also not the first etf to use free cash flow as a factor see also cowz ttac neither of which i really like its er is only which is reasonably low for small ish specialty etfs but how does it perform well since inception over years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the s p and ishares us quality and value factor etfs every step of the way gotta admit im kinda impressed their top holdings right now are jnj unh intc wmt googl hd pg csco amgn and avgo surprisingly compared to spy theyre most underweight in financials i wouldve thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they dont compensate for banks having a different business model than say jnj really neat non market cap weighted etf sdg ishares msci global impact etf this fund tracks an index that seeks to obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the united nations sustainable development goals such as education or climate change ark investing may also be launching an etf with this theme in the future see methodology here its nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in it has also easily outperformed the s p over the past year frdm freedom emerging markets etf its a very new emerging markets etf that is not market cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores top holdings include tsmc samsung and cd projekt red if youre concerned about international tensions and based in north america this could be something youd like also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside china in an emerging markets etf very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox emxc ishares msci emerging markets ex china etf also an ex china emerging markets fund but otherwise it follows a broad msci mark cap weighted index very top heavy in korea taiwan india and brazil its another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your china exposure through some other portfolio choice or have none at all like in frdm you get heavy exposure to tsmc and samsung imtm ishares msci intl momentum factor etf one of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non us markets really heavy on tech and luxury if youre bored of holding efa or vea and want greater returns from non us developed markets check this out it may be something you like high exposure to shopify sony nintendo lvmh swan amplify blackswan growth treasury core etf treasuries plus spy leap options its performance in was great saved you during the crash and gets you most of the s p upside during normal times kind of a barbell strategy an interesting conservative etf probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement amplify has a whole set of thematic etfs much like global x ntsx wisdomtree u s balanced fund another fund that deals with both us large caps and treasuries but in this case it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get equities treasuries total exposure quite a clever package and designed for long term holding with reduced volatility while likely outperforming a balanced fund theres a huge thread on bogleheads org about it with a lot of people who like its design igbh ishares interest rate hedged long term corporate bond etf this is an interest rate hedged long term corporate bond etf you see when treasury yields rise as is expected the next year or two corporate bond yields also rise but that means the price of the bonds goes down bad for bond etf values hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities but avoid the interest rate risk a whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister etf lqdh in the past months because of historically low treasury yields ok heres a bonus ppa invesco aerospace defense etf this is a broad defense industry etf and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year but the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit a good etf to have watchlisted us and allied defense spending keeps chugging along also many of these companies may be in cathie woods arkx ita is an alternative but lacks hon which is an important company in the sector disclaimer this is not financial advice and i currently have no position in any of those etfs at time of posting but that may change at any point in the future what do you guys think any of those look like something you might invest in anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small medium sized fund edit hours after op wow this post blew up im so happy many people are finding this

250,disclaimer i am not a financial advisor this entire post represents my personal views and opinions and should not be taken as financial advice or advice of any kind whatsoever i encourage you to do your own research take anything i write with a grain of salt and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch also full disclosure i hold a net long position in gme but my cost basis is very low and im using money i can absolutely lose my capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours before i get into mondays action a couple of things i wanted to first give a shout out to u piddlesthethug for capturing this screenshot which shows that moment in time i referenced in my third gamestop post where some poor soul got sniped while sweeping the january calls i added it into the post with an edit but my guess is most who read the post a while back would have missed it i guess my mental math in the moment was off as you can see from the image that the cost was actually just shy of rather than as i wrote in the post brutal people have also asked me where i stand on this trade i was lucky to get in early trade some momentum and retain a sizeable core holding relative to my play account as ive mentioned some comments my core holding which i will hold until this saga plays itself out would buy me a new car all cash though after today id have to downgrade from a lower end lexus to a corolla lol alright so todays action i have to admit that i was just glancing at the chart between writing emails working on excel spreadsheets conference calls and meetings whenever i could i was listening to cnbc in the background and taking a closer look whenever i heard anything that might move sentiment or theoretically telegraph an attack as had happened so many times last week in my opinion the price action played out almost by the numbers according to a squeeze campaign strategy as i laid out in my previous post i want to be clear however that while it was consistent with what i laid out liquidity drying up trying to skirmish at lower and lower price points you could reasonably interpret it other ways as i mentioned in at least one comment seeing things play out in a manner consistent with your expectations is by no means positive confirmation that your thesis is correct it just happens to be consistent with the evidence you have so far always keep that in mind i tried responding to a few comments and questions in realtime as i got notifications on my phone just as a heads up i wont always be able to do so and it seems like there were a number of knowledgeable people commenting in realtime anyway as ive said in comments on my previous posts i am definitely not the smartest person in the room so dont just take my word for it just because im the original poster please challenge anything i say if you feel im mistaken and dont dismiss out of hand people who may have a different viewpoint one thing i thought i noticed in early morning market hours action was that there was no sell order depth above the ticker price which i interpret as a good sign downward pushes into fairly good volume got sucked back up largely in a low volume vacuum the most extreme example of this was the first push right at market open tons of volume to push the price down then a tiny fraction of volume as price got sucked back up this means very little continued panicking and bailing due to the aggressive push resulting in gaps to the upside on the follow on buying there were messages and comments from people concerned that low price would let the short side cover but as i explained low price doesnt help the short side unless they can buy at that low price in meaningful volume that sort of action where price gaps up as soon as buying whether by shorts or longs is driving price tells you that there isnt much meaningful volume to be had at the lower prices from a higher level view volume through the day dropped as price dropped and that seems to have remained consistently true throughout the day there was some very strange after market volume no idea what that may have been other than maybe hedge unwinding as t contract settlement outcomes were determined it seemed at least to me to be too much volume in too dense a time window to be retailers bailing out of their accounts en mass it would make no sense to do so into the vacuum of after hours anyway rather than the firmer price support of market hours i got messages that i was both a short side hedge fund shill and a long side pump and dump fraudster trying to somehow take peoples money my sentiment analysis kpis thus indicate im likely striking a healthy balance lol the game theory ok but seriously is this situation a pump and dump possibly i say possibly because as i stated in a comment a failed squeeze campaign is effectively identical to a pump and dump in that the only thing that happens is capital is transferred mostly from people who got in later to people who got in earlier even worse in aggregate a good amount of capital may end up being transferred from the campaigners to the short side not that it was necessarily intended to be that way from the start its just what ends up happening if the campaign fails ok so failure aside what are the dynamics of the trade what kind of game is this in simplified terms id describe a squeeze campaign where the short side doubles down as a modified dollar auction where the winning side also takes the losing sides bid money in other words at an aggregate level its winner take all go hard or go home with all the excitement of market action in the middle note that i said in aggregate and with market action in the middle as that basically means even the winning side will have individuals who lose possibly everything if they get washed out before the end as i mentioned in some comments where i urged people to consider taking profits if they needed the money this is going to be a white knuckle trade to the very end power for most of our lives most of the time the saying that information is power and the closely related knowledge is power are abstract philosophical truisms that people say to try to sound cool and edgy more tangible and relevant to our daily lives might be money is power or for the least fortunate the threat and reality of physical force today for many in the gme trade that previously abstract philosophical truism gained intense and urgent relevance what is current si can you trust numbers from what about ortex are there counterfeit shares in play what is the significance of failures to deliver can the short side cover their position off the exchange etc etc being in this situation if nothing else has lifted the veil for many people the right information in the right circumstances is incredibly powerful it outlines in stark contrast the power dynamics of information asymmetry if you want to exercise more agency in your future as a trader and investor you have to make a habit of cultivating your critical thinking skills and ensuring you have diverse and often divergent sources of information do not let yourself be trapped in an information bubble where you can be easily manipulated most of all try to avoid developing a siege mentality at all costs if nothing else in my opinion its critical for your long term financial success i dont know the answer to those questions definitively and my purpose in creating this account and posting is absolutely not to get people to listen and necessarily believe everything i write in fact it would make me happier if i see people use some of the tools techniques and concepts ive tried to introduce to challenge some of my thinking catching my mistakes helps me doing it in the open for all to read helps everyone faith conviction calculated risk many people trade and invest according to wildly divergent strategies some people including those that most wall street types consider to be responsible investors invest on blind faith you put your capital is someone elses hands hopefully a qualified fiduciary and trust that they will do a good job the only judgment you exercise really is in choosing the person s in which to place your faith this is not entirely unlike what many wsbettors are doing with respect to dfv i do this with my retirement accounts though lately ive been considering transferring about half my retirement capital to a self directed ira others trade on conviction they have for whatever reason a very strong belief in an investment thesis that they are willing to put to the test by putting capital at risk and are willing to lean into the thesis through unfavorable price action so long as no disconfirming evidence comes to light i consider value investors to fall into this category others are momentum traders and technical analysts who are trying to read the market data to look for asymmetrical calculated risk opportunity these opportunities need not necessarily be tied to any particular underlying fundamental investment thesis all that matters is whether you win on a sufficiently frequent basis and carefully manage your downside risk i think its healthy to try to gain an understanding of all three approaches i personally also find it necessary to be careful if you find yourself switching between those approaches mid trade i e if you started in the gme trade on faith it may be deeply disturbing if you find yourself in the no mans land between faith and conviction where you have learned enough to understand more of the risks in the trade but not enough to understand the underlying investment thesis of how it could play out im not saying you shouldnt try to make that transition just try to maintain self awareness if you choose to do so to avoid making any rash decisions swimming in the deep so the consistent question i always get what happens next my consistent answer which i know frustrates everyone is i dont know and no one else does either one person in the comments made an astute observation that perhaps the truth which some may find disturbing is that our fate really lies in the hands of the whales on the long side rather than retail being in the drivers seat this may very well be true i would give it better than even odds at this point in fact even if retail collectively represents more shares in this trade retail is not a well organized monolithic entity and therefore would have more difficulty playing a decisive role at critical times another question i got which was a very good one to be asking is what evidence do we have that there really are whales on the long side for me there have been critical actions over the past few days that i would have found to be highly unlikely to be achievable by retail investors such as the sustained hft duel into the close on friday that was very consistent relatively well controlled and sustained push on volume of shares traded in the share price range oversimplified math would peg that at just shy of in capital flow that is not retail particularly with so many retail brokerages restricting trading at that time the shares sold into the aftermarket action consistent with a squeeze and ortex reported reduction in short interest is also definitely not retail others have pointed out massive action in the options today tons of block purchases in the millions of dollars and high figures not retail all of that being said does that really change very much even if you consider yourself to be part of a movement and have genuine feelings of solidarity with your retail fellows i do which is why im writing these posts and holding that core position in the end you are trading as an individual this is a point that i have made repeatedly in the end you need to know yourself know your trade and have a plan your plan may conceivably be to follow someone else i know many are following dfv to whatever the end may be but in the end even that is still your plan as an individual if my thesis is correct we will continue to see lower trade volumes and price grinding down to a floor of harder support possibly even at the retail line of support i outlined in a prior post there may also be some price dislocation tomorrow depending on options contract t settlement impact i dont know enough about what to expect there if the squeeze is to happen unless rh lifting restrictions or people transferring their accounts causes a surge of retail momentum it will happen after that type of price movement continues for a while maybe days maybe longer until sufficient liquid float has been locked up right now options action is heavily weighted to puts so any market maker hedging activity will put more pressure on price if the squeeze fails to happen there wont be a siren ringing of a bell or anything like that it might happen gradually and non obviously until suddenly as only the market seems to be able to do it becomes obvious that whoevers still there has been left holding the bag hopefully this isnt the case but if it is ill be right there with what at that point may only buy me a razor scooter rather than a car lol if it succeeds it should be fairly obvious just dont forget to ring the register either way this is market history in the making as i said in a previous comment when you ride the rocket its definitely not going to be smooth but it might just be awesome apologies for the lengthy post again good luck in the market,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,investing

256,op youre getting trashed in the comments because you have a fundamental misunderstanding of economics your level of knowledge seems to amount to big numbers are scary its hard to argue with someone who lacks so many fundamental basement level facts for starters youre trying to interpret the nations economy through the only economic lens youre familiar with your own household budget and thats absolutely wrong for you money can only be spent if it can be earned for you every dollar you become indebted you must eventually pay back for you money is a tangible asset a store of value which you must trade something else of value for your labor your property your skill etc none of this is true for a government like the united states the us government issues its own currency it also spends solely in that currency can you create your own warren bucks on demand can you buy real goods and services with them can you pay down your debts no but the us government can why because of taxes if the government stopped collecting taxes tomorrow the value of the dollar would evaporate its taxes which can only be paid in usd which gives the dollar its inherent value there exists in this country a debt which every person must pay and which can only be satisfied with usd otherwise you end up in jail if the government spent in murica bucks without taxing in that same currency nobody would accept them as payment if the government suddenly started demanding taxes in that currency people would be lining up to earn them because theyd know they can spend them on to other people who also have tax obligations to fulfill this is the fundamental value of fiat currency fiat meaning currency that is willed into existence it has value because you need it more than you need any other valuable object barring food and water death and taxes are a constant and you need usd to pay your taxes this inevitability this unavoidable constant is also partially what gives the dollar stability and gravitas people are content to save it and people are content to use it as a medium of exchange because it has the ability to pay a debt that no other substance on earth can the dollar is more powerful than gold just go try to pay your tax bill in gold nuggets if you think thats incorrect so now that thats out of the way lets rewind taxes give the dollar value but what about the us government and its ability to create usd out of thin air well thats part two of why comparing government finances to your personal finances is a recipe for paranoia its literally the root cause of hundreds of thousands of gadsden flags to be hoisted across america by well meaning patriots but heres the truth not only do taxes in the modern era primarily exist to give fiat currency value they arent even necessary to fund government thats right your taxes dont fund a single fucking thing in fact the money you send to the irs is essentially destroyed the little ones and zeroes the banks move from one spreadsheet to another when tax day arrives doesnt really do anything why because and were really beating the horse here the federal government is the sole issuer of dollars in the world and can create that currency out of thin air whenever it wants it does not need your tax money to spend it can create it does it make sense to you that if the us government can create dollars out of thin air they need to wait to collect yours first fucking no and this should hopefully bring us to the next great revelation to you money is a store of value to the us government it is not a store of value how could it be a store of value when the government can alter the amount of it at will either by increasing taxes and destroying it or by creating and spending more of it into the economy thereby increasing its supply so what the fuck well to the us government money is a tool not a store of value the governments role is to use the supply of money to regulate the economy in a recession it can use its enormous power to connect idle labor with idle resources to create real economic growth by spending money into the economy government can will dollars into creation and then use it to buy things from people and businesses that are otherwise experiencing no demand in a down economy this isnt financial voodoo its using money as a fucking tool the way a government is supposed to use it when the economy is hot and unemployment is low then government can do the opposite take money out of the economy to avoid inflation either by spending less increasing taxes raising interest rates which motivates people to trade their dollars which dont pay any interest to government paper like bonds and treasuries which do while simultaneously taking their dollars out of the circulating supply the major point here is that government is not revenue constrained and that debt to the government is absolutely fucking irrelevant because and this is the real kicker if youve followed me this far the national debt is a fucking account artifact an irrelevant holdover from the days when we spent in a currency we did not control like gold today the national debt reflects the number of dollars the government has spent into the economy and each one of those dollars exists as savings in the non government sector in other words if the government spends into the economy its you and i who are the beneficiaries that money is used to buy real goods and services and we are now richer the call to pay down the debt is literally a call to say we want the government to remove money from the economy to reduce an irrelevant accounting artifact that scares us because were fucking ignorant to finally address your original concern about how much government paper the fed is holding thats actually a good thing the economy is fucking hot as shit right now and inflation is finally starting to ramp up unfortunately we have a congress filled idiots who blocked every bit of government spending back when we had a recession years ago and who now when the economy is hot are spending like drunken sailors ironic since theyre the ones who were complaining about the short road to hyperinflation for the last decade while inflation languished around and the economy suffered from high unemployment because none of those stupid fuckers could wrap their heads around the fact that government finances are not analogous to household finances and that they should allowed the government to step in and bridge the gap between idle labor and idle resources but i digress holding all that paper allows the fed to soak up all the extra money being pumped into the economy at a time it doesnt need it tax cuts increase the money supply huge government spending bills increase the money supply interest rates are going to go through the fucking roof so buy a house now if you want one in the next years,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,investing

258,per cnbc after years of sears holdings staying afloat through financial maneuvering and relying on billions of ceo eddie lamperts own money the year old retailer filed for bankruptcy the filing comes more than a decade after lampert merged sears and kmart hoping that forging together the two struggling discounters would create a more formidable competitor it comes after lampert shed assets and spun out real estate all to pay down the debt the retailer accumulated when that plan went askew the company still has roughly stores which have at times been barren unstocked by vendors who have lost their trust many of the stores have never been visited by a generation of shoppers that can barely recall it was once the the countrys biggest retailer lampert who has a controlling ownership stake in sears personally holds some percent of the retailers shares outstanding according to factset his hedge fund esl investments owns about percent ultimately it was a million payment that did the company in the company had a payment due monday it had not the money to pay other forces were at play too sears creditors refused to agree to a restructuring proposal they had little assurance by way of collateral or strategy after years upon years in which sears only shot at survival came by selling off parts of its business over quarters only one yielded positive same store sales growth as of late september sears tallied billion in current debt its board was in a perilous spot its special committee was tasked with approving lamperts other plan a bid to buy his storied kenmore appliance business and other brands approving his offer would have helped sears make its payment but it would also thrust the board the spotlight potentially opening them to the threat of litigation from shareholders who might allege lampert has stripped the business bare homes to hardware that business was once a giant it started with richard sears who launched the sears watch co in to sell watches by mail the company later evolved into sears roebuck and co which sold everything from homes to hardware through a catalog the convenience brought its products to americas most rural locations in sears morphed a mail order plant on chicagos west side into its first retail store by the end of the year sears opened seven more stores eventually sears became the largest u s retailer and its house brands like kenmore and craftsman earned spots as staples in homes across the country generations of children marked the holidays by paging through its holiday catalog known as the wishbook wondering if they would receive any of the toys inside as sears success grew so did its empire it moved into chicagos iconic sears tower and for a time owned financial services businesses like dean witter and coldwell banker real estate group but walmart topped sears as the biggest u s retailer in its efforts to attract female shoppers by showing them the softer side of sears and move into new businesses lines left it without a identity those challenges didnt stop lampert the hedge fund manager who had already impressed wall street with his acumen when he seemingly turned around kmart which he bought in he acquired and combined sears with kmart in arguing that two ailing retailers were stronger together than apart the financial guru saw valuable real estate customers he could parlay from one store to the other and ample costs to cut the retail giant he created had a market capitalization north of billion in the media began to wonder whether he was the next warren buffett lampert could have sold off his investments then but stayed on steadfast in his vision of the combined retailers meanwhile walmart and target kept opening stores as did lowes home depot walmart touted its everyday low prices while target served up cheap chic lowes and home depot provided a wider array of home improvement products for all kinds of projects making it tough for kenmore and craftsman to compete then came a double blow consumer spending slowed during the great recession especially for big ticket items like washers and dryers cash strapped shoppers began using the internet to hunt down the best deals gradually they began to spend more online and avoid the mall fueling amazons rise sears square foot stores began to seem monstrous as foot traffic declined walmart and others began to invest in their businesses to compete with amazon but sears never had that chance it simply didnt have the funds sears last profitable year was in a thinning cash flow has left little money to put back into the company itself letting it become more irrelevant for the past five years the ratio of sears capital expenditures to sales has been less than one percent thats even as its sales have more than halved in the same time period sears has been in survival mode for more than a decade unable to rely on the sears business to pay the bills lampert instead sold or spun off many of its most valuable stores and brands since its merger with kmart sears has spun off its lands end clothing brand sold the craftsman tool brand to stanley black decker and closed hundreds of stores it spun out of its best properties into real estate investment trust offshoot known as seritage its key vendors wary of sears future demanded tighter payment terms some like whirlpool stopped shipping all together it has been grappling with a pension of roughly retirees that as of january was underfunded by billion according factset it became a guessing game among analysts and onlookers whether each of sears last five holiday seasons would be its last but lampert kept surprising them extending a lifeline in the form of loans from his hedge fund esl investments or finding them elsewhere each time bankruptcy looked inevitable lampert though sounded the alarm in a sept blog post he pleaded for sears creditors to agree to restructure calling out the risks should they drag their feet we continue to believe that it is in the best interests of all our stakeholders to accomplish this as a going concern rather than alternatives that could result in significant reductions in value he wrote by early october it became evident that sears last christmas before bankruptcy had already passed sears began to raise emergency financing to support the business through coming filing now the question will be whether sears will be able to come out of bankruptcy retailers dont have a great track record of emerging several of late like toys r us and department store bon ton have been forced to liquidate it is difficult to make changes needed like investing in e commerce stores and a companys brand while still catering to creditors demands,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,investing

271,due diligence of bitcoin mining stock valuations riot and mara unlike the rise of bitcoin the bitcoin price action has been largely driven and influenced by institutional demand with institutional demand comes institutional products we have seen bitcoin derivatives bitcoin trusts and more recently a new way for exposure to bitcoin price action publicly traded bitcoin mining companies there are two bitcoin mining companies which id like to review for you here both trade on nasdaq they are riot and mara lets begin with a quick summary on bitcoin mining what is bitcoin mining to mine a new block on the bitcoin blockchain you must find a number called a nonce the cryptographic combination of the nonce next block content must be numerically smaller than the networks difficulty target more on this below generating a new nonce is extremely computationally expensive there is no shortcut miners must try calculations over and over again until they brute force the correct result they are trying to find the answer to a math problem a nonce that hashes correctly with the sha cryptographical hashing function the bitcoin network adjusts how many computations must be done on average to find a valid nonce every weeks this is called the difficulty the aim is to have a new block mined approximately every minutes this means that if the mining power is doubled the difficulty is made harder double the energy for the same amount of bitcoin we can see an estimate for the total hash rate being applied to the bitcoin network today notice that it is about th s right now million trillion nonces tried every second so for every block every minutes attempts are done sextillion until one lucky participant finds a valid nonce and can mine the next bitcoin block in doing so they get rewarded newly generated bitcoin some bitcoin in transaction fees from users of the network you can run code on your computer to try and find the next bitcoin block in fact this is how all bitcoin mining used to be done however these days you will end up spending more on electricity than you mine in bitcoin this is because people have developed special asic chips designed specially for brute forcing the sha function these chips are a factor of times more efficient than your computer mining on an asic bitcoin miner the biggest producer of asic bitcoin miners is a chinese company called bitmain they produce miners run many of the miners and even run many mining pools where people can collectively search for the next block and split the profits bitcoin mining becomes incredibly profitable when there is a rapid price increase in bitcoin this is because there is a lag while new bitcoin mining hardware is being built and deployed to capture excess profit so lets take a look at how profitable it is to run an asic miner today the antminer pro is one of bitmains latest machines it can run an impressive th s and uses of power on their website bitmain is listing them at per machine but in bulk companies can buy them for as low as notice they are sold out until at least august so machine cost using kwh electricity costs benchmark for electricity cost in china we get per hour in electricity costs assuming we run this gives us in electricity costs per year and how many bitcoin will we mine well at th s on an asic machine we are capturing of the total bitcoin network per machine at current total hash rate bitcoin blocks mined per year bitcoin reward per block bitcoin in transaction fees avg right now bitcoin per block blocks bitcoin per year for the entire network of this is bitcoin per machine per year revenue at per bitcoin profit per year you can play with the parameters to figure out different profit levels for example if the total hash rate doubled to th s profit per machine would drop to per year also note that transaction fees fluctuate over time depending on how many people are actually using bitcoin sending and receiving transactions see historic transaction fees and how long can you run a machine for running so many calculations slows a machine quickly additionally new faster hardware is introduced making past hardware unprofitable fairly quickly as a rule of thumb we can expect a machine to be profitable for about years this is also the rate at which companies mark the depreciation of miners on their balance sheet in year the machines become much less profitable than initially there have been studies to see where bitcoin mining is occurring through ip address analysis of miners working in pools the university of cambridge has a real time map in which we can see that in mining was country total hash rate china russia us kazakhstan malaysia iran riot and mara now that we have a basic overview of how bitcoin mining works lets look our new investment phenomenon publicly traded nasdaq listed bitcoin mining companies riot incorporated in july the company was renamed to riot blockchain in october the company now exclusively mines bitcoin and has a partnership with coinmint llc in new york who operate the miners riot was a penny stock for most of its existence and was irrelevant until mid how many miners do they have current status of pre dec orders miners in operation and more to be delivered funded from secondary offering in oct in december their stock price rocketed alongside bitcoin in months they took advantage of this and ran a secondary offering raising with this money they ordered more miners for expected delivery starts in may with the bulk to be delivered in october summary machines at full deployment machines today and wont be running the rest until so ignoring the cost of the machines operational machines at profit per year per machine full capacity machine at profit per year per machine and assets maybe in cash btc left over from secondary offering and past assets note they may get cheaper electricity costs through their partnership and claim as low as per kwh in some releases mara incorporated in the company has a wild history it first engaged in the exploration and development of uranium and vanadium then real estate in southern california and most recently patent trolling the company has some questionable leadership and has also been a penny stock for most of its existence in i think the company began delving into bitcoin mining in september they purchased bitmain miners th s for notice that at th s these machines are far from profitable today im not even sure they were profitable back then so more recently they own current status of pre dec orders miners in operation and more to be delivered funded from secondary offering in aug in december ran another secondary offering after their stock price went from in a month they raised with this money they ordered more miners delivery of in july in december for in january they ran yet another secondary offering raising more they used of this to buy bitcoin at per coin summary operational miners per yr full capacity dec miners per yr they also made on their bitcoin holdings so far impressive numbers right well too good to be true so what are riot and mara trading at you may ask with the recent jump of bitcoin to riot and mara have rocketed riot closed at per share a market cap of mara closed at per share a market cap of investor euphoria is at all time highs so much so that their price action has rapidly outpaced and diverged from bitcoin so is it because they have such huge potential if riot gets all of its hardware delivered is it really going to be making per year and mara per year well probably not as bitcoin price goes up mining becomes very profitable and there is a rush to build and deploy more hardware from oct to dec the price of bitcoin famously went from to total hash rate went up about during this time however it went up a massive over the following months as new miners were produced and deployed with a lag as the price of bitcoin capped out and then dipped mining soon became unprofitable at such a high total hash rate and miners lost a lot of money both riot and mara are pending receipt of the majority of their miners and wont be taking delivery until late early what will the networks total hash rate be by then what will bitcoin price be by then chinese miners wont be sitting by idle and we ignored the cost of the machines in the future riot and mara will need to buy new machines regardless of the market the old asic miners will quickly trend towards unprofitability bitcoin is closed system there will only be a maximum of tx fees of bitcoin mined per year in fact this will reduce in with the next halving a company cannot reliably mine more bitcoin capture more of the network because if they are finding it profitable to increase their hash rate then you can be certain every other miner is doing the same how many secondary offerings can they do for this free lunch take a look at the past financials of these companies riot mined an impressive worth of bitcoin in their costs were in electricity rent etc depreciation once you add in their of salaries and marketing they had an operating loss of for the quarter their bitcoin did appreciate by a cool meaning their net loss for the quarter ended at of course their next quarter should look wildly better thanks to bitcoins price action but this is not a business that is massively profitable under normal market conditions the bull case bitcoin keeps rocketing and never comes back the total hash rate doesnt catch up and btc becomes btc maras revenue next year becomes before asic miner production catches up investors doubled their money of course if it becomes so profitable one wonders if bitmain decides it is better value to use the miners themselves and breach their contract tobins q simply stated when you invest in a riot or mara you are investing in the profitability unprofitability of bitcoin mining over the next years it could be hugely profitable or it could crash and burn like it did in and you see no returns in this instance you are paying the executive team of mara and riot to buy the hardware plug it in and sell any bitcoin for you there isnt much more to it than that you could buy the hardware yourself and run a few machines if you found a good electric company to partner with for cheap electricity so perhaps a good way to see what kind of premium you are paying to own bitcoin miner exposure through these nasdaq companies is the q ratio the q ratio is the market cap of the company divided by the replacement costs of its assets riot market cap current btc miners ordered btc miners cash remaining guess a whopping q ratio of and of that is cash in orders mara market cap current btc miners ordered btc miners in bitcoin cash remaining guess a value q ratio of with this approach riot is trading at a premium today and mara a a criticism of this valuation methodology may be that it is justified paying a premium when orders for new hardware are so backlogged just remember that these companies are also stuck in that backlog and wont have most of their machines online until is it really worth such a premium other factors to consider these companies have questionable management the ceo of mara has awarded himself compensation in excess of over the last few months realise that the market cap of mara was less than just months ago both companies are quick to do secondary offering after secondary offering at such high prices mara has been more aggressive recently and the downward pressure of insider selling and secondary share offerings has resulted in the price moving from in the time riot has gone from a read through both of their qs will give you paragraphs of legal claims shareholder class actions and past investment write offs due to corruption shady circumstances these companies have no moat they have no ip they have no key talent hires they are simply ordering asic miners plugging them in and having the biggest pay days of their lives trading strategies so is there a trading strategy i would recommend bear the challenge with being a bear in this market is you have to seriously consider whether the risk reward is there for betting on the downside right now the market doesnt care for your fundamentals bitcoin has passed the narrative is that its going to the market expects these stocks to continue to trade at multiples and be higher in a month it sounds ridiculous but it keeps happening it is far too dangerous to be short these stocks or worse short calls and you could be bankrupt on intra day move so that leaves you with puts average implied vol nearing does not make them cheap if you truly have conviction that there will be a correction in the near term then consider weekly bear spreads longer dte plays are insanely expensive and run the risk of the many secondary offerings eventually justifying a price higher than your price target another interesting idea would be a relative trade if you could find exposure to bitcoin mining at premium your long run earnings could net out however all publicly traded companies are similarly ludicrous so youd have to buy a stake in btc mining privately or try and own some asic miners yourself more simply you could go long bitcoin and short riot mara this should converge in the long run the risk is that short term the short position will be impossible to risk manage and there is always the risk of more secondary offerings bull buy as far otm weekly calls as you can at iv and hope that momentum market continues fundamentals are for the other both riot and maras stock price spent some time consolidating down from to the range when bitcoin corrected back from its initial run up back to to it is possible they will again if bitcoin has a pullback however the price action of these stocks has diverged even from bitcoin for the time being ultimately the price action we are seeing now is purely momentum hype technical and probably retail driven long term and as far as future earnings go this play is a loser but be careful that doesnt seem to matter right now disclaimer this is not financial advice do your own dd and trade at your own risk positions i hold put debit spread for feb for each company tldr bitcoin mining stock valuations are about as crazy as the valuations of all growth stocks in this market fuelled by retail demand of people who dont know what a blockchain is but their crypto millionaire friend told them its revolutionary the greater fool investing,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,investing

284,hello wanted to share my thoughts on palantir ahead of its earnings next tuesday edit sorry i got the day wrong in the title but the date is correct lockup expiration is also didnt realize palantir was reporting before market open warning long post ahead and tldr at the bottom palantir business overview in one sentence palantir creates operating systems that integrates vast amounts of data from an organizations various data silos and allows users to build applications that drive better decision making if thats confusing no worries the way i like to think of palantirs software is that if batman purchased the software from a company today for his supercomputer which aggregates data from thousands of sources and allows him to make intelligent decisions that software would be from palantir the company has three main software platforms gotham foundry and apollo gotham government side gotham is palantirs software offering primarily for defense and intelligence sectors aka governments gotham is an end to end operating system that collects data from hundreds to millions of different sources and combines them onto one platform so users can manage operations gotham is quickly becoming the de facto data solution across many us federal agencies andrumor has it that it was the software that helped track down osama bin laden in foundry commercial side next up is foundry a platform that is geared towards the businesses around the world with over million in revenue similar to gotham foundry transforms the ways organizations operate by creating a central operating system for their data for example one of palantirs customers is skywise anaviation platform that has become the central operatingsystem for the airline industry apollo underlying infrastructure apollo is the last piece of the palantir puzzle and you can think of it as the underlying infrastructure that gotham and foundry lie upon apollo is a relatively new platform that palantir introduced in order to more efficiently update the software that runs gotham and foundry increasing the number of upgrades palantir can manage across installations from an average of per week in to more than per week in the company has estimated its total addressable market as billion of which billion is for the government side while billion is for commercial side the palantir business model known as forward deployed engineers or fdes palantir leverages their technical talent as support and sales as well and they are often sent to the front lines of the battlefield for gotham or company for foundry i believe that this in particular is what helped palantir create a competitive moat in the government sector while the fdes are a differentiator palantir has also started to build out a more traditional salesforce in order to better target customers and explain the companys value proposition but this salesforce currently only accounts for of the companys total headcount using both fdes and a traditional salesforce palantirs business model employs a step process acquire expand and scale acquire in the acquire step palantir provides a potential customer with a short term pilot program at palantirs expense and therefore operate at a loss expand in the expand phase palantir seeks to understand the customers key challenges and ensure that its software delivers results scale the scale phase is where palantir thrives at this point the customer is essentiallyusing palantirs software for its operations and palantir can alsoupsell to the customer by continuallyoffering new services with minimal extra cost to give you a sense of the numbers for each phase in palantir generated a total of million in revenue of which million came from customers in the acquire phase million from the expand phase and million from the scale phase the bull case section in palantir sued the us army in whats known as decision to go into the history a little bit in the federal streamlining acquisition act fasa was passed which required that the federal government consider and acquire readily available proven commercial services like palantirs rather than custom developed solutions built by the government which has a reputation for spending inefficiently this rule was largely ignored until palantir sued and won in court and this was extremely important because it allowed palantir to compete and win deals across all federal agencies which greatly helps the company realize its total addressable market since then palantirs revenue from the us army and us government has skyrocketed sticky best in class product simply put there is nothing that offers what palantir is offering its technology is way beyond most of its competitors in terms of offering a premium operating system palantirs gotham and foundry often take more than a year to get fully up and running and the more its used the more data in the system and the more time that has been spent by customers training employees on how to use the system palantirs platforms becomes incredibly expensive to switch out of not just in terms of money but also time with customers saying replacing the system could take anywhere from to months to further prove this point palantirs top customers have been with the company for an average of years and as of october of revenue was generated by existing customers in addition to this in the latest quarterly earnings palantir was selected out of bids by the us army for a year million contract to build ai and machine learning capabilities positive secular trends and growing achievable tam i think everyone at this point realizes that companies are going digital transformations and palantir has spent billion in the past years creating innovative software that becomes increasingly powerful each day the company is at the right place at the right time with a total addressable market expected togrow into the few hundreds of billions of dollars in the next years and with just about billion dollars in revenue over the past months palantir has less than market share and has plenty of room for growth but perhaps most importantly palantir is creating a much more efficient business model with an improving tech product that will help the company achieve its tam in the latest earnings call management said that it plans to triple its salesforce headcount due to its recent success and among other improvements the apollo platform has helped thecompany greatly reduce the costs and time required to get a customer up and running being able to better target customers and onboard them quickly while providing a best in class and sticky data platform points to a bright future for palantir the bear case double edged business model while palantirs differentiated services and business model is one of the companys key strengths there are also several downsides as well first due to the custom built solutions palantir offers the company undergoes a costly and complicated minimum month sales cycle that can often amount to nothing second even if a customer jumps on board contracts are cancelable with a typical notice of months third the deep history it has with customers results in a very top heavy concentration as of the third quarter of the top customers represented of the companys revenue which notably is down from from the year prior lastly the deal by deal nature of palantirs business model means that the sources of revenue are lumpy and hard to predict which can be a cause ofconcern for investors biden administration and negative headline risk first peter thiel was an outspoken supporter of trump who increased defense spending a year while obama decreased spending a year while i dont think this will be a long term issue a biden presidency does represent a potential decrease in defense budgets which could hinder palantirs growth with gotham however it is important to note that management during its latest earnings call did address this issue stating that it has worked with many administrations across the world and doesnt foresee this to be a problem second palantir has been targeted by the media several times for giving the government too much power and the political and social environment in which the tide seems to be turning against tech could present palantir with headaches in the future this risk is also further exacerbated by the fact that palantir is owned by its co founders who are outspoken and strongly opinionated clear corporate governance risk tough competition in commercial space in my opinion the largest obstacle palantir faces is its ability to execute in the commercial space palantir offers an expensive premium custom built end to end solution for clients which is great for the government but not exactly what most businesses are looking for instead most large scale businesses have already invested heavily into their own systems and want to buy best in class piecemeal solutions from different tech companies several notable businesses left palantir from to including jp morgan coca cola and american express and this decreased the customer count from to however one important thing to note is that in the latest earnings call palantirs management openly addressed this issue and the company has already started to provide solutions that are modular which means customers can take the individual solutions they want rather than adopting the entire foundry system this also allows thecompany to offer different price points which may allow palantir to bemore competitive in the market recent news of bringing on bp and ibm as clients could also be a sign that its foundry business may be ready for mass adoption lock up expiration because this is a short term risk im adding this as a bonus bearish reason palantir went public through a direct listing on september during which up to of shares were available to trade edit thx for pointing this out for employees and stakeholders not all available shares outstanding this remaining roughly of shares outstanding is available to trade starting february when the lockup expires and this could lead to a flooding of shares being sold and at the very least volatility caused by the uncertainty financials and valuation starting off with the income statement the important things to note is that from to the company has grown revenue by about while maintaining roughly the same amount in operating expenses which speaks to the improved operational efficiency of thecompany the company has guided to billion for the full year of which represents a year over year increase and for acompany with billion in revenue increasing revenuegrowth is a great sign comparing to the company was able to increase averagerevenue per customer by and grew commercial revenue by andgovernment revenue by with all thissaid one piece of concern in palantirs income statement is its net losses the company has not been able to turn a profit in its entire history but it did report positive adjusted operating income in its latest quarter when adjusted for stock based compensation moving onto its latest cash flow statement what you mainly need to know isthat the company has recently had a huge stock based compensation expense this past year due to the direct listing so if you were to add that back the company is essentiallynear break even however the companys free cash flow operating cash flow minus your capital expenditures is negative so the company still is clearly losing money although much less than even a year prior lastly palantir has a great balance sheet with billion in cash and only in debt the company is in a great position to fuel its future growth regarding the companys valuation while the company is growing nicely at from and is expected to grow from based on street estimates it currently trades around a ntm sales multiple depending on the day which makes it one of the most expensive companies on the market the key question here is do you want to pay an extremely high premium for a company that does have a best in class software or wait for a better entry point what im doing personally i cant justify palantirs valuation which may sound a little old school but i think there are better opportunities out there however in the long run i am bullish on the company and would buy on any major dips in the and teens if it somehow falls down to that im also closely monitoring what happens after earnings and next week the lock up expires on so itll be interesting to see what happens to the stock then tldr palantir has a best in class sticky data platform that it offers to both the government side where its pretty much a monopoly and businesses which is picking up steam with tweaks to the business model and a growing salesforce growing healthy top line but unprofitable and trading at a higher valuation than almost all other software companies i am holding off on buying for now but would welcome major dips as great buying opportunities edit wow did not expect this to blow up im pretty new to posting on reddit and will continue to post my dd also thank you

287,throughout the lifecycle of bitcoin ive heard this statement over and over again bitcoin is gold for the century bitcoin is protection against jpows printer bitcoin prevents against usd debasement i have nothing against blockchain tech on its own i think there are some wonderful aspects to the technology with that said the amount of narratives used to sell bitcoin to others that are just completely wrong on a variety of levels is getting to be rather stupid and given todays selloff its a good opportunity to explain how the narrative is completely disconnected from reality bitcoin as inflation protection bad narrative i have said for a long time that bitcoin is a risk asset its yet another in a long line of strong performing financial assets that have done well in our environment of excess liquidity and low inflation in this light its not that different from the growth investing asset class if bitcoin actually served as any form of inflation protection then why in the world did it tank on the day that we got the highest yoy cpi print in over a decade and nobody can argue that it was a product of interest rates rising since they havent risen in any significant way since that inflation print and its now tanked almost at a time when you would expect any idea of inflation protection to be the strongest driver of the asset class something doesnt add up here why make up incorrect beliefs to justify purchasing something when there are perfectly reasonable bull cases to be made that arent dependent on misleading people on the economics of inflation and money printing and for whatever its worth gold suffers from some of the same problems although it obviously behaves a bit differently than crypto bad economic narratives dominate bitcoin beliefs how many times do people need to show you charts before they actually take a minute and compare to the actual inflation levels hint for those who arent aware growth in is meaningless if it causes an equivalent drop in the velocity of money how many times do people need to call quantitative easing money printing without understanding how quantitative easing actually works hint the money printing comes from temporary fiscal stimulus not from the fed pushing reserves that are never used onto banks balance sheets how many times do people misunderstand that asset inflation which is just another word for a bubble is different than consumer price inflation hint real consumer price inflation is typically rather negative for more speculative risk assets such as bitcoin how many times do people need to suggest the us dollar is getting killed before they actually look at a price history chart of the us dollar hint the us dollar is more or less right in the middle of its price range over the last years is significantly higher than it was throughout the entire time period from and hasnt even dropped that far this year despite the massive amount of stimulus fed swap lines used since the covid pandemic you would think that if the us dollar was actually debasing we would get more than a drawdown during the largest stimulus package ever my personal subjective opinion is that bitcoin is yet another risk asset that benefits largely from too much money chasing too few assets this is actually in part a product of quantitative easing but the irony here is that qe is not actually causing inflation i think blockchain will likely be used in the future for a wide variety of uses but i have no clue whether bitcoin will serve any actual functions aside from speculative ownership note i do not own any crypto or crypto oriented stocks so i dont have anything to either gain or lose here and by the way this is not intended as a bullish or bearish post on bitcoin just trying to debunk some of the very obviously incorrect narratives that have been sold to the public over the years,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,investing

post example of trades calendars and hedges i wanted to chat a bit about options here i realize that there are already plenty of articles about options that you can find online but many are either overly complex oversimplified trying to sell you some products etc i figured i would explain some of it here in order to reduce the learning barrier after all knowledge is power and given the recent event with robinhood i figured it is worth repeating how options work so you understand what is happening under the hood and dont end up taking too many risks and making mistakes that you could regret later if you are interested in trading options i invite you to look for more details online i have been trading options since i made some mistakes so many especially in the beginning over the years i kinda reduced my option trading activities but these past few months i have been doing it much more as there are so many opportunities and the market is so volatile which helps with my trading style this first post is to explain how options work in general the second post will go into some more details the third posts and will explain some standard strategies and the fourth posts and will give some examples for my recent trades with gains and losses and how i approach option investing if you are looking at r wsb style of investment please skip these posts they are not for you i am a relatively conservative investor and will avoid pure gambles but i will still take some calculated risks so i say it is fair to say that most of my money is invested in standard etfs mutual funds real estate so my option play represents only a percentage of my overall wealth it is often perceived that options are extremely risky and one of the best ways to get ruined for some trades this can be true to dispel a myth in reality options can also be used to be extremely conservative even to a point where you barely make any money at all in any market unlike for shares where you can only control the diversification with options you have a much bigger control on the risk profit profile time and volatility is also a factor that you can profit or lose from one thing to note is that not all companies or etfs provide options for their shares the basics call and put contracts strike and exercise options are split into two groups calls and puts both have a strike an expiration date and a number of shares attached to it well talk about the exercise and expiration date a bit later when you buy a call or put option you buy a contract with a party through your broker and the stock market usually one contract represents shares the strike corresponds to a share price for the underlying instrument so for spy that is worth today you will have options with strike but also etc from to options strikes are created as the underlying instrument spy goes up and down for spy strikes have a granularity of around the share price but can also be or even farther from the current price some other instruments have a or even granularity it can even have a granularity hello hertz it dropped so much that the lowest strike is right now a call is a contract that allows the buyer to buy a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date if you buy a call with a strike and the share price went up to reach this allows you to buy some shares at that are now worth the action of exchanging your call against some shares that you bought at the strike price is called exercising the call when you exercise your call contract you are buying shares into your account remember that in most cases contract will buy shares in your account when exercising each call contract you will need of cash in your account in this example for the strike multiplied by shares and the same shares are now worth at for each share not accounting for the price you paid for the call option more on this later this means you will make a profit of if you sell the shares conversely a put is a contract that allows the buyer to sell a number of shares at a given strike price before an expiration date if you bought a put with a strike and the share price went down to this allows you to sell some shares at that are now worth each similarly to a call the action of exchanging your put against some shares that you sold is called exercising the put when exercising each put contract you are selling shares from your account when exercising each contract your shares will be sold for for the strike multiplied by shares and the same shares are now worth at for each share not accounting for the price you paid for the put option this means you made a profit of if you did not have the shares per contract in your account you would be actually short selling the shares and you could make the profit by buying these shares back in summary a call buys shares when exercising a put sells shares when exercising most importantly in the vast majority of the cases you should actually not exercise your contracts but instead you should sell your call or put at the market price as you will increase your profit see extrinsic value later brokers do not allow you to exercise the contract if the difference between the strike and the current value is going to make you lose money in other words you cant exercise when the current value is below the strike for a call you want to buy low when the value is high or current value is above the strike for a put you want to sell high when the value is low most brokers do auto exercise your call and put contracts at the expiration date if they can be exercised if the contracts cannot be exercised at the expiration date and you did not sell your contracts before they will be worthless and the money you spent buying the contracts will be completely lost although i am mostly talking about american style options that can be exercised at any time there are also european style options that can only be exercised at expiration in the us markets pretty much all stocks and etfs are american style but the cash settled indexes like spx and rut are european style the basics intrinsic and extrinsic value a call or a put contract costs money to buy called a premium so a party can give you the right to exercise the call or the put after all they wont take the other side of this contract for free and they have to be remunerated the minimum for a contract is per share for some very liquid etfs but for most instruments it is thus per contract for shares when you buy a call or put this premium is the most you can lose by expiration date the party that sold the contract to you is open to many more risks and potential losses see below the value of the call and put contracts will depend on the strike on the share price going up and down the shares volatility how fast far it goes up or down and the time passing when you buy a contract the strike and the expiration date is known however the share price and volatility will constantly change all the call and put options are constantly repriced as time is also passing closer to the expiration date the intrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that only depends on the strike and the current share price it is above only when you can exercise the contract the extrinsic value is the portion of the contract value that depends on the volatility and time for pretty much all options this extrinsic value is above and will slowly drop to as we get closer to the expiration lets take an example with a share price of say you buy a call with a strike of expiring in a month for the intrinsic value is the extrinsic value is said differently if the share price did not move at all until the expiration date your call contract would bring you per share you would have lost due to the time passing similarly you buy a put with a strike of expiring in a month for the intrinsic value is the extrinsic value is it is worth noting that any call with a strike price at or above has of intrinsic value if you pay for a call all the is extrinsic value if the stock price does not go over you will lose the full per share so a loss per contract similarly a put with a strike price at or below has of intrinsic value if you pay for a call all the is extrinsic value your contract will be worthless by expiration if the stock price did not drop under note that in these examples i use the same price for the call and put options that are away from the strike price but its not always the case the call and price options are priced differently depending on the volatility market expectations potential dividends cost of money etc the basics atm itm and otm there are few definitions related to the relationship between the strike and the current share value for puts and calls an option is at the money atm when the current share value is matching the strike the share price is and the strike of for both the call and put contracts will be considered at the money an option is in the money itm when the contract has some intrinsic value the share price is so a call at is in the money with of intrinsic value a put at is in the money with of intrinsic value too an option is deep in the money when the option is itm and the strike is far from the current share price for example more than for example with a share price of a call will be considered deep in the money same for a put conversely an option is out of the money if there is no intrinsic value with a share price a call is out of the money a put is out of the money the money you paid for the call and put is purely extrinsic value there is no intrinsic value an option is deep out of the money when the option is otm and the strike is far from the current share price for example with a share price of a call will be considered deep out of the money same for a put as the share price goes up and down depending on the option strikes it can switch between itm to atm to otm the option price will always reflect that and will be based on the time at expiration and the current share volatility few key things to note the deeper itm an option is the more expensive it is as it gets deeper itm the intrinsic value increases the extrinsic value decreases you have a higher chance for the option to be worth something and you will lose less money on the extrinsic value the price of deep itm options will move very closely to the underlying shares a positive correlation for calls a negative correlation for puts the deeper otm an option is the less expensive it is again otm option price is pure extrinsic value you have a very small chance for the option to be worth something by expiration the maximum extrinsic value is when the option is atm it is purely extrinsic value with barely any intrinsic value these option strikes are the most sensitive to time volatility and share price here is an example with the same share price of for a call you could get something like this strike premium intrinsic extrinsic deep itm strike premium intrinsic extrinsic itm strike premium intrinsic extrinsic atm strike premium intrinsic extrinsic otm strike premium intrinsic extrinsic deep otm you can imagine the same table for a put but in the other direction it is worth noting that if you have a call and you decide to exercise it you would directly get of proceeds per share but you would also destroy the extrinsic value to losing of proceeds instead of exercising your call you are much better off selling your call for in general there are not many reasons to exercise your options selling them is more advantageous the next post will continue talking about the basics of options post basics call put exercise itm atm otm post basics buying and selling the greeks post simple

343,i have been curious about how to time my contributions to my ira is it best to do dollar cost averaging over the year dump it all in at the beginning or try to time the market i did a little study where i downloaded the last years of the s p index and compared five different ira investment strategies heres the exact spreadsheet i used for those who want to take a look at the numbers if youre interested in a more visual journey you can check it out here i wrote it out as a little story with fictitious characters to make it a little less boring five way to time your ira contribution steve mike larry tom and paul were college friends who graduated years ago on they day they graduated they made a pact to max out their iras every year starting in it was a traditional ira back then as the roth wasnt introduced until they continued contributing every year for years from every year they maxed out their iras as allowed by the irs over the years the irs has changed that contribution limit as follows maxing out their iras for those years each of the friends contributes a grand total of in cash save or invest steve had heard that the stock market was risky so he decided to never actually invest his money and instead left it in a money market account inside of his ira the other four were ahead of their time and knew the power of buying and holding index funds they all decided to invest of their contributions in a single s p index fund and never sell but each had a different strategy about when to make the contribution and investment lets see how they fared steady saving steve steve hated the thought of losing his retirement money and heard the stock market was risky so every every month for forty years he would contribute of the maximum allowable ira contribution to his ira and leave it invested in a money market account basically an interest paying cash account his account earned interest which was a bit of a wild ride over the years since the interest rates were over wow for many months in the early but under from through with his slow and steady saving and consistent interest steves nest egg never went down in value and grew to by the end of monthly maintenance mike mike also contributed money once per month in equal amounts of of the annual contribution limit but instead of leaving it in a money market account mike always invested it in an s p index fund he left it alone and never sold anything his monthly strategy grew his investment to at the end of beating steady saving steve by lump sum larry larry didnt like waiting or making monthly transactions so on the first day the market was open each year larry maxed out his ira and invested it in his s p index fund in a single lump sum his lump sum strategy grew his ira to at the end of beating monthly mike by terrible timing tom tom also dumped all his money in at once each year but he had the worst timing possible instead of buying a little each month or buying all at the beginning of the year tom invested the moment of the absolute peak of the market each year for example in he dumped all his money at the peak right before black monday only to watch the value of his ira drop by more than a third over the following few months but he never sold and stuck to his terrible timing for years his strategy netted him at the end about less than monthly mike made perfectly precise paul paul also dumped all his money in at once but paul was omniscient he was only person on the planet that pinpointed the exact instant of the market low consecutive years and at that instant he optimized the potential value of his ira by dumping every penny of the annual max contribution and happily watched it go up for the remainder of the year pauls impossibly perfect precision earned him the most of any of the five friends even with his ability to see the market bottom before it happened he still only beat lump sum larry by the lesson all four of our index fund buyers handily beat the savings account by well over they were wise to understand the power of buying and holding an index fund without worrying about the volatility of the market terribile timing tom and perfectly precise paul showed that even the worst or best possible timing really doesnt change things all that much and the realistic strategies that larry and mike employed were pretty close with lump sum larry coming out slightly ahead so if youve got the cash dump it all in on january if you like the idea of dollar cost averaging set up auto investments so it happens every month without having to look at it but the important thing is to invest early and often edit if anyone is interested i do a lot of stuff like this over on my instagram im not selling anything make no money from it etc if linking to this is too self promotey ill happily take it down,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,investing

349,after a long time of very responsibly trading blue chip stocks for modest gains single digit gains last week i started contriving a plan to get into oil and hit it big i spent at least hours considering all my possible options then on monday afternoon it became clear to me it was time to strike i put of my money in tuesday morning was not fun heres what i learned dont ever buy something you dont fully understand on monday i bought into uso as oil prices bottomed thinking i was buying into a fund that was purchasing up all of the may futures contracts i thought uso was rolling out of april and into may and they were conveniently buying up all the worlds wti at bottom of the barrel pricing i saw the warnings all over the place that people didnt understand that uso was based on futures not spot prices i knew uso was buying futures not spot i thought that meant i understood the warnings i didnt know that the real risk was that i didnt know which months i was buying into the funny truth is that they werent even making most of their moves on monday i was way off dont trust third party sources on the details not even your bank both yahoo finance and my bank rbc direct investing have incorrect information on uso and most major etfs for as long as i have been looking weeks theyve said uso is holding april wti futures this is false i thought this meant that uso had to sell all those contracts and move into may contracts on monday i thought uso was being paid to take a bunch of oil that they would then have all month to get rid of but thats not how this works the word etf is used extremely loosely an etf like spy or zqq to is absolutely nothing like all the etfs out there that are attempting to track daily movements of _ _ _ _ _ _ _ an etf is just a fund dont buy into etfs that you do not fully understand read the actual prospectus do not underestimate the number of stupid investors out there as i watched wti plummet in real time i immediately saw uso skyrocketing i thought for sure that meant that smart institutional money was piling into uso i thought there was no way that retail investors could move a fund that fast but they were that was not smart money causing the pump it was a million idiots like me dont fuck around with leveraged etfs in addition to uso i purchased into a leveraged wti tracking etf hou to at the very end of the day on monday i thought for sure on tuesday morning the oil prices would bounce back up from negative and give me a big bump i figured even if it didnt work out i could hold onto it forever until oil comes back wrong you cannot hold onto these things forever they trend towards mathematically if you cant make gains in your first couple of days or weeks you are probably stuck with taking a loss you shouldnt even hold these things more than a single trading day especially in this crazy market despite your fathers advice you cant just be patient and hold on to everything hou to which i purchased into is beyond toast the company has all but told investors its time to cash out after the fund lost of its value on tuesday they froze it and then released an official press release that the etf was worth about of its already obliterated market price they then said pretty clearly that they no longer expected to be able to achieve the funds objectives after a few cuss words i basically kissed my money goodbye then much to my pleasant surprise on wednesday morning i saw it was back up for trade somehow it was rising this goes back to not underestimating the power of stupid money i cashed out immediately and was very pleased to get of my money back everyone around me was telling me to be patient and not take a loss the fund has done nothing but post double digit losses since then yet millions of people are continuing to trade it when they should instead be cutting their losses while june futures are up since tuesday this etf is down like yet people still cling on the biggest lesson in these oil etfs is that nothing is certain in this crazy ass market a ton of the pain that i felt this week was caused by uso and other funds like them restructuring uso has been rolling front month futures on a predictable calendar for years on tuesday morning they absolutely fucked my investment in uso and probably contributed to the obliteration of hou to by surprising us all with a restructuring announcement i never in my life thought that uso was going to restructure i thought the whole point of it was that they were legally obligated to follow a certain predictable futures trading pattern and that certainty gave people a mechanism to buy and sell nope they can legally just do whatever the hell they want costing retail investors like me an arm and a leg while their fund managers continue to make figure salaries last but certainly not least this week should be a lesson to us all that there are mammoth sized financial incongruities hidden in every corner of the global economy right now the insanity that has taken place in the oil industry this week should be a warning bell to us all the crisis was caused by bad assets in a single industry considering the demand for everything is down by at least and the governments have propped the world up with free cash equivalent to over of global gdp its quite certain that there are sub prime mortgage backed security

373,tldr the porsche family is getting full control of porsche the company literally for free this is the main reason for the ipo the way the ipo is structured will hurt vw and gullible investors buying into this vw and its long term strategy are thrown into disarray tldr with light details the porsche family already owns a significant chunk of both vw and porsche companies but they want full control of the porsche company they ousted the ceo of vw on a pretext and forced the ipo that benefits only them the family will get additional of the porsche which will give them full control of the company the family is not paying a market price for stake in fact they are not paying at all because they forced vw to pay a dividend from the ipo proceeds which the family will get by being a shareholder of vw shares available to the public during the ipo are all non voting long story the way the ipo is organized is a disgrace and if the german government allows it to go through as is i will have no faith in making long term investments in german stocks anymore if this is legal under german laws then im not buying if this is illegal and they dont do anything im not buying either to understand what and why is happening you need a little context so here it is the porsche family lost control of the porsche company during the financial crisis they wanted to buy vw but ended up in a weird financial situation where they instead had to give up control of porsche to vw but got a controlling voting stake in vw the ownership structure is complicated but in a simplified form it looks like this the family porsche holdings vw company porsche company the ipo will make it look like this the family porsche holdings vw company of voting rights the family porsche holdings porsche company of voting rights the money flow is like this the family buys of voting shares from vw below market price with no competition vw pays of ipo proceeds as dividends the family gets its money back from vw in the form of dividends this ipo would be a disaster even during normal times vw is losing its best cash cow for half the price and the price is below market rate but its happening during one of the worst times for ipos ever the stocks are in a global downturn hammered by inflation rising rates quantitative tightening supply chain issues and ongoing war in ukraine which amplified all of the above and added energy crisis on top of that germany is in the worst economic situation since the fall of the berlin wall this is not the right time to ipo a luxurious brand however this is the best time for the family to get their favorite asset out of vw from their perspective the less money ipo makes the better this conflict of interests is as bad as it gets ipo shares available to the public will be useless non voting shares for gullible investors who do not understand what they are buying think snap or goog but it gets worse lets remember for a moment that vw was not a good company for a long while it ended up in a diesel gate scandal had to pay enormous fines as well as to change its ceo this turned out to be a blessing in disguise because vw got a good new ceo had to reinvent itself by becoming more environmentally friendly and thus started an early transition into evs vw is already a top seller of evs in europe and rapidly growing its market share it has a vast portfolio of cars ranging all segments from the cheapest economy cars to the most luxurious ones of which porsche is the main brand platforms within vw are interchangeable they use the same tech across multiple brands to achieve synergy now if you take porsche out these plans are thrown into disarray on top of that both porsche and vw will have the same ceo answering to the same family which company do you think he will prioritize more when it comes to that whats more the transition to evs was not going smooth already there are issues with software which vw was never good at historically and the labor unions were very unhappy at the potential loss of jobs because you need less jobs to make evs the family seized on this opportunity to oust the ceo under a pretext that the software was delayed and the labor unions supported the change to get their job guarantees the labor unions now expect to keep their jobs meaning vw will have to keep combustion engine factories operating for longer for no economical reason this is good for workers but a disaster for investors in vw the family got their ipo which is good for them but also a disaster for investors and the new ceo has no experience in building software whatsoever with no sound plans to address the problems the right change for vw would be to hire an experienced executive vp from one of the major tech companies in the us and improve their software development culture there was no need to change their ceo especially considering that vw was transitioning to evs better than all of its competitors but oh well my positions i owned vw stock for a while and sold at profit after the war in ukraine started but was planning to buy back later now however if the ipo goes through im not touching this stock or any other german stocks for that

379,how could an equity manager that has been in the game for over years and relatively unheard of suddenly make a splash with ark what was she doing before ark i have been able to dig into her past performance and the results of which are below quick summary she has a long history of running funds that fit under discovery growth or global thematic styles cathie has a great track record outperforming the s p but much of this has been due to outperformance of growth style also this assumes you catch the very early cycles of her outperformance when compared to category style almost all of cathies major outperforming years come during special periods in the market cycle particularly in the periods following a market crash with one other period of great performance during the btc bubble craze outside of those special events cathies funds generally underperform equivalent style peers on a year by year basis she has a history of leaving a fund during or following a period of underperformance then rebooting in another fund this includes a short stint in a hedge fund that lost over of its aum before getting into the deep dive a quick note on benchmarks cathies investment style fits into one of two flavors us growth and global growth the s p is not an appropriate benchmark at all for a growth oriented or global oriented fund instead for the years available i will benchmark her to the russell growth and msci world large cap index as these fit her investment universe and demonstrate whether an investor would have been better off with a passive index fund additionally im going to compare her performance to some matching t rowe price funds why t rowe price first their security selection universe is similar to cathie woods they tend to prefer growth oriented companies i e think amazon rather than phillip morris secondary they have been around for a while and their funds have history dating back earlier than the indices i will be using finally for another reference point i will benchmark against yahoo finances category averages for years where no index data is easily available in summary to benchmark her discovery growth funds i am going to use the i shares russell growth index iwf subject to years available as well as t rowe prices new horizon fund prnhx to benchmark her global fund i am going to use vanguard total world vt subject to years available and t rowe prices global stock fund prgsx for years where no index data is easily available i will instead use yahoo finances category averages average of of active fund performance after fees jennison associates this is the one period for which i could not find any performance data as there are only a handful of surviving funds from that period she was apparently a portfolio manager and chief economist i tried looking up fund history on the sec website but could not find anywhere she is listed as a manager even after searching shareholder reports for the period its possible whichever funds she worked on are no longer around so unfortunately we need to skip this period tupelo capital services cathie co founded this hedge fund in right as the dotcom bubble was building steam arks company profile boasts that she managed million in assets in interesting that they give this figure for the very height of the market bubble in as the market bubble crashes cathie leaves tupelo capital unfortunately there is no accurate performance history for this hedge fund but i have found aum filings from the sec in the funds aum reached billion source in the funds aum then reached billion source by the aum shrank to million matching cathies stated figures source finally by the end of the aum shrank to million source in other words the funds aum shrank roughly over and note that this would have been due to a combination of asset losses as well as investors pulling out so its not possible to know how much of that is due to actual equity losses by comparison t rowes global equity fund lost across roughly in line with the category average unfortunately vanguards total world index vt did not exist during this timeframe alliance bernstein after cathie left tupelo capital services she joined alliance bernstein during her tenure she managed three funds that i could find ab discovery growth chcix a discovery growth oriented fund ab sustainable global thematic fund altfx ab strategy research portfolio note that this is a separately managed account sma not an open mutual fund i will use the acronym absrp all further sources will be at the bottom cathie outperforms category underperforms t rowe absrp before fees prnhx category absrp beats its category as the recession unfolds but loses to prnhx note that cathie joined some time in so its uknown how much of a contributing factor she was during this period cathie outperforms category outperforms t rowe absrp before fees prnhx category cathie underperforms category underperforms t rowe absrp before fees after fees prnhx category after fees cathie outperforms category outperforms t rowe absrp before fees prnhx category cathie underperforms category underperforms t rowe absrp before fees after

management is onboarded for chcix i have no information as for the management shuffle only what i see on morningstar source cathie outperforms category outperforms t rowe altfx vt prgsx absrp before fees after fees prnhx after fees growth category after fees cathie mixed against category mixed against t rowe absrp before fees after fees growth category after fees prnhx altfx vt prgsx in cathies separately managed account sma underperforms whereas her global fund outperforms cathie underperforms category underperforms t rowe altfx vt prgsx unfortunately no more data available for absrp starting this year cathie underperforms category underperforms t rowe altfx vt prgsx unfortunately no data available for sremac for this year cathie underperforms category underperforms t rowe notes cathie left alliance beinstein in early full year performance is still shown as its likely that some or most holdings from cathies tenure were kept by the new manager altfx vt prgsx ark years for the ark era i am going to use arkk to evaluate her performance im using arkk because first and foremost it is her flagship fund and secondly because her specialty funds while interesting are nearly impossible to benchmark against for another comparison i am also going to add another passive fund to the mix vanguards vgt technology index in addition to the russell growth n a there is no full year history for arkk in cathie underperforms t rowe underperforms passive benchmarks i am using for arkk are iwf ishares russell growth and vgt vanguard technology etf as a secondary benchmark it turns out to not make a difference whether a year is a underperform or an outperform arkk vgt iwf prnhx cathie underperforms t rowe underperforms passive arkk vgt iwf prnhx cathie outperforms t rowe outperforms passive arkk vgt iwf prnhx summary this is without a doubt the breakout year for cathie wood how was this done can you guess what was the biggest contributor to her outperformance hint it wasnt an equity holding a position in bitcoin investment trust is by far her top contributor netting her basis points of compounding outperformance in and check out their quarterly reports and youll see its not even close note that the contribution of this is more than simply the compounding of because this compounding is based upon the base of all assets in other words i estimate her actual returns without bitcoin would have been about still great but brings it down a bit more towards earth return return without btc return without btc estimated return without btc return without btc estimated return with btc included cathie underperforms t rowe outperforms passive arkk vgt iwf prnhx cathie underperforms t rowe underperforms passive arkk vgt iwf prnhx cathie outperforms t rowe outperforms passive arkk vgt iwf prnhx bears no explanation we all lived through the fun in the market last year in case it isnt obvious her biggest contributor for the year was tesla however there were many others as well and overall it was a much more balanced return profile versus that of my take on ark the following comes directly from arks own faq arks funds are fully invested and do not hold a material amount of cash ark generally will not use cash in a tactical manner let me explain in layman speak what this means here the algorithm cathie follows to buy or sell when cathie receives inflows she buys when cathie receives outflows she sells sounds a lot like the algorithm for a passive fund you see unlike most active funds cathie is not tactically using cash nor thinking of limiting inflows even as she now sits with many billion aum and continuing to pump money into existing positions unlike cathie top active shops tend to hold higher cash positions during times of market euphoria and close funds when they are performing too well the exception to this are mega cap blue chip funds but cathie is not running a mega cap blue chip fund the t rowe funds in my benchmarks for example are currently either closed or restricted to new inflows fidelity has done the same with very successful small or mid cap funds let me quickly summarize what imo are some of the best virtues of a good active manager keep cash onhand and deploy it only when there is a reasonable risk reward tradeoff sell if the risk reward tradeoff is no longer to the best interest of your clients even if this means selling to a cash position if your cash grows too large or if your fund performs too well you should consider closing the fund as otherwise it attracts short minded performance chasers if there is a great buying opportunity i e a market crash and your fund is closed you should open your fund to solicit new inflows you should try to keep your assets under management aum small if possible the larger your aum the more difficult it is to make a winning bet on a small cap lets say for example you wanted to bet of your portfolio on san jose water company sjw an infrastructure holding of mine well their total market cap is less then billion if your aum was billion youd need to buy the entire company outright just to make a small dent in the portfolio your marketing to your clients should be reasonable and not overpromise telling your clients your goal is to beat the s p on a risk adjusted basis is fine as long as you are clear about risks involved i do not see cathie following any of the above instead i am seeing a combination of dangerous behaviors actively soliciting more inflows even when total aum across ark funds exceeded billion this is forcing more purchases into existing overcrowded positions advertising that arkk should double your investment in years regularly putting out videos promotional materials interviews etc promoting the house holdings with price targets significantly above most industry targets i do not believe cathie is acting in her investors best interests intentionally or not i believe ark is essentially a pump scheme buy companies with a marketable story and small revenue base but large revenue growth promote the companies heavily sell investors on the story solicit inflows use to buy more into those positions sometimes owning up to of the company my theory is that this in itself is jacking up the price of those companies sit back and watch the stocks price grow at a faster rate than revenue growth this is not sustainable until well until what you now hold a basket of companies trading at very high p s ratios some of them might become the next google but surely they all wont become the next google you can try selling them to some greater fool but good luck doing that with of billions in aum edit lots of posts about how ark cannot control inflows because its an etf this is true and not cathies fault but nonetheless its a problem or at least its fair to say its a flaw in the structure of active or concentrated etfs ark is now suffering from the big aum problem too much capital to chase after too few opportunities victim of its own success additional sources,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,investing

391,in legendary investor and founder of the baupost group seth klarman described in his annual letter lessons from the financial crisis which were either never learned or else immediately forgotten by most market participants with him at the helm the baupost group has averaged around and that since a spectacular return some of these lessons are even more relevant today i took the most important ones and updated it for the current market things that have never happened before are bound to occur with some regularity you must always be prepared for the unexpected including sudden sharp downward swings in markets and the economy whatever adverse scenario you can contemplate reality can be far worse nassim taleb calls these black swans an event that comes as a surprise has a major effect and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of examples would be the internet the personal computer world war i the dissolution of the soviet union and of course the coronavirus these all changed countries or continents for decades with shutdown still in place in several countries in the world the economys output is much lower than it was at the end of yet we reached an all time high in the stock market new mutations are evolving and there might be a sharp downturn in the future or there might not history taught us that market crashes are much more common than we think so it is important to be diversified in different asset classes industries and countries to be protected against those changes when excesses such as lax lending standards become widespread and persist for some time people are lulled into a false sense of security creating an even more dangerous situation in some cases excesses migrate beyond regional or national borders raising the ante for investors and governments these excesses will eventually end triggering a crisis at least in proportion to the degree of the excesses correlations between asset classes may be surprisingly high when leverage rapidly unwinds with interest rates in europe being partly negative and extremely low in the us people are lulled into borrowing to get onto the party of rising stocks and that on margin margin on portfolio reached an all time high in december of and the number of retail traders thanks to robin hood exploded even with the recent controversy in addition central banks in europe and the us are printing money like there is no tomorrow these money policies have driven stocks to a new high and the excess of government debt mirrored that progression action always have consequences but however harsh they may be one thing is certain if the current price is higher the returns wont be as great in the future nowhere does it say that investors should strive to make every last dollar of potential profit consideration of risk must never take a backseat to return conservative positioning entering a crisis is crucial it enables one to maintain long term oriented clear thinking and to focus on new opportunities while others are distracted or even forced to sell portfolio hedges must be in place before a crisis hits one cannot reliably or affordably increase or replace hedges that are rolling off during a financial crisis we all chase profits that is just how it is however conservative positioning and a long term oriented perspective is crucial most people in thought they would buy the dip when their favourite stocks started to decline however the decline didnt stop the nasdaq posted a loss of which would take years to regain the dotcom bubble during the financial crisis many couldnt sell their stock because there were no buyers even retail investors that thought they could get out couldnt during it janus funds were similar to ark today investing in modern technology companies and industry they were one of the top cutting edge technologies janus were lauded as great money managers but the end of the bubble resulted in brutal loses cathie wood is one of the smartest investors today but one has to keep in mind the inherent risk that comes with her investment strategy similarly we saw extreme loses in gme chasing after returns purely on performance will not result in great results risk is not inherent in an investment it is always relative to the price paid uncertainty is not the same as risk indeed when great uncertainty such as in the fall of drives securities prices to especially low levels they often become less risky investments this is the quintessential art of investing your returns will entirely depend on what price you paid microsoft was a great company but buying it during the dotcom bubble would leave you years with no returns and several other well known companies like cisco or intel never reached their dot com peak your returns are entirely dependent on the price you pay and so is the risk factor do not trust financial market risk models reality is always too complex to be accurately modeled attention to risk must be a obsession with people not computers assessing and reassessing the risk environment in real time despite the predilection of some analysts to model the financial markets using sophisticated mathematics the markets are governed by behavioral science not physical science because of this behavior we see certain securities being extremely highly valued like zoom at the moment and certain sectors being very depressed like oil until recently yet oil is seen as extremely risky even though the projected use of oil will increase in the next years that means that you can find bargains all the time those bargains are declared risky while the overvalued stocks are declared safe microsoft after the dotcom bubble only recovered in years of no gains at all yet now microsoft is treated like a company that will be a great stock forever it is a great company but the same was thought about companies like polaroid or kodak we saw how it turned out do not accept principal risk while investing short term cash the greedy effort to earn a few extra basis points of yield inevitably leads to the incurrence of greater risk which increases the likelihood of losses and severe illiquidity at precisely the moment when cash is needed to cover expenses to meet commitments or to make compelling long term investments this can be highly dangerous and i see it all the time here on reddit someone wants to use the money in years to buy a house yet instead of proposing a portfolio that is safe and diversified in several asset classes most propose a stock only portfolio and sometimes even sector or ark etfs research has shown that a stock only portfolio will beat pretty much every other asset allocation that is over the long term due to the ups and downs of the market it doesnt guarantee returns in years or even worse can lead to loses from and from the s p has shown long stretches of no absolute return investing before a correction that you cannot foresee would result in either big loses or in the inability to purchase that house often both so be conservative when you need the money the latest trade of a security creates a dangerous illusion that its market price approximates its true value this mirage is especially dangerous during periods of market exuberance the concept of private market value as an anchor to the proper valuation of a business can also be greatly skewed during ebullient times and should always be considered with a healthy degree of skepticism this is especially true today many stocks are currently at outrageous prices i dont talk about the fangman stocks these have great growth and while still being historically overvalued not outrageously so several ev green biotech weed technology stocks are seen as the next big google without decent cash flows and while competing in the same space this is especially true for unprofitable companies at the moment according to joel greenblatt if you bought every company that lost money in that had a market cap over billion and so theyre about companies youll be up percent so far until today something like that wont be sustainable looking at the fundamentals behind the business often makes it clear how unreasonable some of these numbers are and what returns should be expected of them often negative you must buy on the way down there is far more volume on the way down than on the way back up and far less competition among buyers it is almost always better to be too early than too late but you must be prepared for price markdowns on what you buy we saw that during the financial crisis and also again in those that bought on the way down were generously rewarded you never know when the bottom will hit especially since everyone will run around in panic like a beheaded henn researching the fundamentals of a company one can score great businesses for cheap however they might go down a bit in the short term due to market panic financial innovation can be highly dangerous though almost no one will tell you this new financial products are typically created for sunny days and are almost never stress tested for stormy weather securitization is an area that almost perfectly fits this description markets for securitized assets such as subprime mortgages completely collapsed in and have not fully recovered ironically the government is eager to restore the securitization markets back to their pre collapse stature as spacs and bitcoin dominate the current market this warning is very important spacs and the companies behind them havent had the greatest return over the long term with the explosion of spacs going public chances are high that those financial products can be very dangerous add the risk that spac managers often get big compensation packages and try to hide information to increase the price doj investigation from clover these investments should be taken with the utmost caution not only that but they also compete in the same space the same applies to bitcoin while i believe that cryptocurrencies will have a bright future they have yet to be tested during prolonged market downturn where the market was negative not just a few week but several months or even years no one know what the price will be then and some investors might wake up to a bad surprise it is important to know these risks ratings agencies are highly conflicted unimaginative dupes they are blissfully unaware of adverse selection and moral hazard investors should never trust them that what makes short seller research so important while there are a lot of crocks in the financial market both on the long and the short side these people often find what the rating agencies or investment banks ignore if you invest into a company and there is a short report dont dismiss it often they include information that was previously overlooked be sure that you are well compensated for illiquidity especially illiquidity without control because it can create particularly high opportunity costs the otc market absolutely exploded in many of these are highly illiquid be prepared for the risk beware leverage in all its forms borrowers individual corporate or government should always match fund their liabilities against the duration of their assets borrowers must always remember that capital markets can be extremely fickle and that it is never safe to assume a maturing loan can be rolled over even if you are unleveraged the leverage employed by others can drive dramatic price and valuation swings sudden unavailability of leverage in the economy may trigger an economic downturn everyone takes debt at the moment it is so cheap that many companies use debt to do buybacks or otherwise increase their price other people trade on margin and governments dont seem to care about debt that can be highly dangerous no one can control interests rates over the long run and bankruptcy is the most surefire way to delete any investment returns peter lynch said if you have no debt it is very hard to go bankrupt while businesses with little or no debt might not rise to the same degree they will reduce the chance of a wipeout significantly when a government official says a problem has been contained pay no attention the government the ultimate short term oriented player cannot withstand much pain in the economy or the financial markets bailouts and rescues are likely to occur though not with sufficient predictability for investors to comfortably take advantage the government will take enormous risks in such interventions especially if the expenses can be conveniently deferred to the future some of the price tag is in the form of back stops and guarantees whose cost is almost impossible to determine we saw that in march the fed stepped in and bailed out the market a decrease in interest rates and intense money printing however the question is how long can it continue and what will happen to those expenses in the future all action has consequences and we saw that some of them can end quite bad seth klarman also added some false lessons that are relevant without commentary false lessons there are no long term lessons ever bad things happen but really bad things do not do buy the dips especially the lowest quality securities when they come under pressure because declines will quickly be there is no amount of bad news that the markets cannot see past if youve just stared into the abyss quickly forget it the lessons of history can only hold you back excess capacity in people machines or property will be quickly absorbed markets need not be in sync with one another simultaneously the bond market can be priced for sustained tough times the equity market for a strong recovery and gold for high inflation such an apparent disconnect is indefinitely sustainable in a crisis stocks of financial companies are great investments because the tide is bound to turn massive losses on bad loans and soured investments are irrelevant to value improving trends and future prospects are what matter regardless of whether profits will have to be used to cover loan losses and equity shortfalls for years to come the government can reasonably rely on debt ratings when it forms programs to lend money to buyers of otherwise unattractive debt instruments the government can indefinitely control both short term and long term interest rates the government can always rescue the markets or interfere with contract law whenever it deems convenient with little or no apparent cost investors believe this now and worse still the government believes it as well we are probably doomed to a lasting legacy of government tampering with financial markets and the economy which is likely to create the mother of all moral hazards the

399,the original design for nikolas flagship truck was purchased by founder trevor milton from a designer in croatia according to two people with knowledge of the matter despite company claims in a lawsuit that the vehicle was initially designed by mr milton in his basement the truck the nikola one is at the centre of a lawsuit with tesla in which nikola alleges its rival infringed on its patents nikola claims in that lawsuit that mr milton began designing the model in with other company staff later working on it in a rebuttal to the lawsuit filed last week tesla alleged that nikola could not protect the designs because they did not originate from the company itself but from adriano mudri a designer based in croatia two people with knowledge of the transaction told the financial times that the nikola founder bought the designs in after meeting mr mudri while visiting electric supercar maker rimac in croatia while teslas filing identifies the designer as the source of the original truck drawings it does not contain details about the transaction explain that money was exchanged or that mr milton himself orchestrated the purchase the latest twist comes with nikola still reeling from accusations earlier this month that it passed off purchased technology as its own covering supplier names on key components with stickers when making promotional videos nikola said it never claimed it made the components in a report that sent nikolas shares tanking mr milton was accused of spreading an ocean of lies about the companys technology and its products by short seller hindenburg research a little over a week later mr milton decided to leave the company telling staff he planned to defend himself against false allegations levelled against me by outside detractors the year old founder has repeatedly insisted that he has not lied to or deceived anyone about the trucks the lawsuit with tesla filed during mr miltons tenure centres on the origins of the designs for the nikola one truck the company claims that mr milton worked for two years on the truck before unsatisfied with his designs he hired designer steve jennes in the lawsuit says the pair then crafted the final design between them in a lengthy process when it was finished nikola had spent several million dollars developing the nikola one according to the lawsuit in its rebuttal tesla said that the designs for the model originated from mr mudri a designer at rimac who had dubbed it the road runner the designs origins could raise further questions about nikolas intellectual property trevor milton chose not to disclose the road runner concept truck to the us patent and trademark office with deceptive intent tesla said in its filing nikola said the nikola one truck was designed and patented by nikola it is commonplace to license third party designs during vehicle development and although early in the process nikola purchased a license to antonio mudris designs he was not part of the design team and his designs are materially different from the design invented by nikola for the nikola one according to several people with knowledge of the deal mr milton sought unsuccessfully to collaborate with rimac on a range of projects in on a trip to rimacs headquarters on the outskirts of zagreb he met mr mudri the companys designer who had designed a futuristic truck as part of an earlier diploma project mr milton purchased the computer drawings and virtual model of the vehicle for several thousand dollars from mr mudri according to two people the road runner name lingered for months a person familiar with the development of the nikola one said that road runner was the internal name for nikolas project the entire time we worked on it a screenshot of a nikola document seen by the financial times shows people being invited to collaborate on the nikola roadrunner prototype project another screenshot shows an early version of nikolas website depicting a truck that appears identical to the road runner in teslas court filing nikola did not mention mr mudri or rimac or say that the designs were purchased in its filing against tesla representatives for mr milton declined to comment rimac also declined to comment,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,investing
400,you dont need to hide from a year old i have a year old and an year old and i can completely envision this scenario youre going through i can help when kids are theyre right at an age where theyre old enough to have a little independence but they arent old enough to have any social awareness also keep in mind that most kids at this age spent at least two years of their formative years basically isolated being told to sit down and stare at a screen or it would be their fault if someone else died so right now all kids in this age range are a little odd you have my sympathy kids arent stupid humans theyre inexperienced humans so when you say you obviously cant tell this kid to fuck off i dont think you realize that you can get him to knock it off he obviously thinks youre pretty cool or he wouldnt be hanging around he invited you to his soccer game dude he thinks youre amazing dont wreck that and i dont think you want to be a hard ass or you wouldnt have written this post but use that to your advantage if he likes you hell respect you kids this age are all about boundaries if he starts with the hi hi hi crap which holy shit destroys me too say hey kiddo i know you like that game but i dont if youre going to come talk to me you only get one hi per day or im not going to respond and then set that boundary hell probably try again and you have to be stony faced and ignore it and hell stop trying if youre trying to do work and he wants to linger and poke around you can tell him to go home hey i really need to focus on this right now so you cant be here if you see me tomorrow you can tell me about soccer and then keep up your end of the deal if you see him the next day ask him about soccer or school or summer camp or whatever give it five minutes and then tell him you have to go back in the house and youll see him later if hes being rude tell him hes being rude kids this age are still developing a sense of humor and they sometimes have no idea if theyre being funny or mean so when hes saying just look harder be direct say hey thats unkind i wouldnt hurt your feelings if you were trying to find something please dont say that do you have a clock outside could you get a cheap one and hang it in your garage or something kids this age are really good with time boundaries you can hang out in the yard until but then im going to need you to go find something else to do i have yard work if he pushes back and he probably will again independence without social awareness take away the access im sorry kiddo you didnt leave when i asked you to yesterday so i cant talk to you today im too busy then stone cold ignore hell get bored and leave in seconds if he comes back the next day ask him if i let you hang out for a few minutes are you going to leave when i have to do grown up stuff if he says yes give him the five minutes keep in mind that if youre planning to live there for a while this year old is eventually going to be a teenager and hes going to go from being an inexperienced human into a pretty useful human need someone to water your plants feed your pets while you travel keep an eye on your house hell babysit your kids if your life changes in the next years if you play your cards right this kid that you find annoying could be the same kid shoveling your walkway in five years just because you were always nice to him one final note this should go without saying but for your own safety and his i would not invite this child into your house at any point unless you were friends with the parents and they gave permission edited to add omg you all thank you for the awards,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,homeowners

413,long story short im a relatively new homeowner and i had to replace my sewer lateral it turned into a big job and the plumber i used was awesome but had to dig up a portion of my neighbors yard to access the main down they were as careful as they could be but damaged a few plants my neighbor demanded not only that they reimburse the plants but that they bring someone in to do the landscaping my plumber is awesome his cousin is a starting landscaper and he got the cousin to come in and do a great job the plumber offered to eat the cost about of the landscaping because it was out of our control and not part of his estimate i insisted on paying and we went our separate ways fast forward a month or so and on a saturday a leaky hose faucet behind my house literally falls out of the wall pouring water into a wall for about seconds and leaving me with no house water turns out the previous homeowners knew the pipe joint was about to fail and had tried to secure it in place with some wood screws around the pipe shocker it failed after trying and failing to contact an emergency plumber i called my sewer guy and just said hey man do you know anyone who does weekend calls and he asked me to send a few photos i did and he just showed up a few hours later did a quick job and refused to let me pay him after all the horror stories i read here i feel like this is a good reminder that there are good people out there and its worth trying to be a good person as well not to mention that i know who im going to call and recommend for any plumbing job for the forseeable future,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,homeowners

444,hi there my wife and i decided to move out of the city two years ago and bought a home built in with acres of wooded land were experienced homeowners this is my house and ive completely gutted and renovated the two prior with my own hands theres a few big mistakes that were avoidable if we would have looked into it and done more homework we thankfully had i stress had a big contingency fund saved up since all new homes have something that goes wrong im hoping this helps someone else well water we had the well water tested by a certified lab before the purchase the results came back safe for drinking but we really should have sent those results to a well water specialist the ph was which is really freaking low and basically destroys copper piping and faucet hardware its also not great for your body this cost us an ph neutralizing system well productivity the well is low producing in the peak summer months this means quick showers and spreading out the laundry loads so it doesnt run dry and fry the well pump theres no way to really measure this but i could have asked the previous homeowner if i knew this was a thing that existed generator we lose power quite often were also on the low priority list after a major storm just due to the number of affected households the house did not have a standby generator in the first year of ownership we had to purge our refrigerator times this cost us a generator and transfer switch setup tree land management i think we were enamored with the idea of having so much land that we really never thought about the maintenance for that much land im okay cutting down and sawing up some trees but fully mature footers are way beyond my comfort zone and leaning a little too close to the house driveway power lines for comfort in my area its about per tree for removal just take a look for this sort of thing if youre shopping electric rates our electric rates went up about just because the distribution fee per kw h is higher out in the sticks septic system we paid for a separate septic system inspection by a licensed specialist there were some red flags which were noted in the inspection but the system was deemed functional after a cleaning and enzyme treatment paid for by the previous owner it wasnt good enough the septic system backs up and floods the leech field after heavy rain were having a new septic system put in in the spring basically i should have just used my brain and said this septic system is years old and hasnt been well cared for instead of putting my faith in an enzyme treatment we still would have purchased the house but the previous owner would have had to cough up some cash for a replacement ticks we live in lyme disease central these woods are crawling with ticks to the point that i had at least one on me every time i went out there during my first summer we have small children and i dont want them to have a lifelong disease it took a lot of smart planning of the property and landscaping to make it less attractive to deer and rodents we also decided to spray a few times a year to keep it at bay all of this is pretty expensive though if you do it right you only have to do it once so far the tick population appears to have gone way down we love it out here and were not naive to think there wouldnt be unplanned expenses its just all of them combined that kind of sucks we would have rather spent that money on nice things to make it feel like ours rather than a poop tank edit a few people are surprised by the cost of the septic theres a few factors to talk about here one is that its a bedroom house so it forces our hand into buying a large gallon system two is that we live in coastal new england one of the most expensive parts of the us for just about everything but particularly skilled trades is on the lower end of the price range i have a friend who lives on the coast and his multi stage septic was so were lucky three is that this includes the mandatory decommissioning and filling of the old tank they take wastewater treatment very seriously around here due to population density and historic pollution problems the first thing we had to do is hire a civil pe to design the system and then have it approved by the dem that alone is,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,homeowners
445,closed on a new house about a month ago and was excited to have a kitchen with viking appliances after opening the fridge a few times i noticed a suspicious ge model number when i searched online for the model number i found the fridge without the viking logo i also noticed the same thing with the convection oven it has a frigidaire sticker inside but viking emblem on the outside after doing a quick search on amazon looks like you can buy the viking emblem and just stick it on anything i doubt i have any recourse on this but figured i would post to make others aware always make sure to get the manufacturer and model of every appliance before you close edit thanks for all the advice my current plan is to at least talk to a lawyer but also keep realistic expectations that it might not be worth it to pursue legal action it is what it is and i may just remove the emblems since they are definitely tacky clearly i need to learn more about the kitchen appliance game because it should have been obvious to me they werent viking also the seller bought the house in from a local real estate guy and i did find that listing it clearly shows the fake viking appliances in the pictures so i think my seller got duped too which is kind of what i suspected however it doesnt mention viking appliances in the listing like my listing did i heard from a neighbor that the real estate guy bought it as a foreclosure from a guy who went bankrupt after a divorce people keep using car metaphors for this so my question is this if you buy a fake mercedes from a guy that doesnt say its a mercedes only has the emblem then turn around and sell it as a mercedes who committed the fraud,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,homeowners

473,first i want to say if you are reading this and replied to my last post i am so deeply appreciative of all the support i received you all gave me a lot of courage to move forward and do more digging so last weekend i knocked on my neighbors door and he invited me inside i wanted to hear what he had to say before i made any movements his first question was well what do you think then i proceeded to give him a dressing down i told him plainly i dont see my tree anymore the others have been completely hacked away at and that he wasnt given my permission to do any of this he just acted dumbfounded and said that he was sorry and thought he had my permission i then proceeded to push at why i wasnt notified like his two adjacent neighbors that there would be tree work happening that day he had the nerve to tell me well it wasnt really on your property i asked how so because there is no fence and that was his reasoning i called bullshit and said the tree and the land they were on is my property and i deserved that much of a heads up even if hed had my permission we surprisingly went back and forth on this point a little bit because he just didnt understand how that was necessary then he apologized again then i asked for his report he had done on my tree before he decided to chop it down he said he didnt have one but he had the quote for the work and he shared it with me so i made note of the companys name and told him how disappointing this whole ordeal was that i was still digesting everything and when i was ready to speak again he would be hearing from me the company finally answered my call today and i heard there side of the story they said he didnt tell them the property the oaks were on wasnt his and its written into his contract that he was responsible for falsely identifying his land i told them i wasnt satisfied with this answer since it was across the road from him they said it was a pretty common occurrence in rural areas for folks to own land across the road from them i pushed back and asked that it hadnt even crossed their minds it might not be his and to double check they said he seemed like an honest older man and he told them the adjacent properties werent his but made no mention of mine not being his land i then asked where my wood from the tree was and they said he wrote it into the contract to have it taken to the dump luckily a fellow neighbor down the road drove by and asked if they could have it so at least it didnt go to waste i just couldnt believe thats where he was going to send the wood there are so many people who can benefit from firewood i asked them to send me a copy of the contract since it involves my property and they agreed they would send it over asap i have yet to receive it but the company quickly brought over seasoned oak firewood and asked me to let them know if there was anything else they could do to reach out at anytime and that they were sincerely sorry for what happened to my trees so as of now im still mulling everything over im pleased the tree company has as far as i know been transparent and that they are making an effort to make the wrong right i get the sense they know they are in hot water my rulings not out and i want to see this contract i have an arborist coming out this week to do a report on the damages then i will be consulting with a lawyer to take a civil suit out against my neighbor put simply he marginalized me disrespected me and my property and im pretty sure it wouldnt have happened if i had a man living on my land so thats where im at i miss my old oaks and just wish none of this ever happened id prefer having my trees as they were over having to rake my neighbor through the coals photos of the work done to my trees,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,homeowners

476,my goal is to get commiseration and to vent and maybe be a cautionary tale if thats not allowed let me know tl dr my house is made of paper and cardboard and i paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for the privilege when we bought this house yrs ago i wasnt in love with the exterior someone described it as burnt orange and having burnt anything in the name of your exterior house color is bad personal opinion but the inside was great and there was potential for the outside so i said to myself with the naive optimism of a first time home buyer its okay that its the color of diarrhea poo well change it we knew going in that our house had a type of compressed paper siding that was all the rage for a year or two in the but then quickly fell out of favor when people realized it was absolute trash they said just keep it painted youll be fine that is not in fact true when we first bought the place i wanted to paint it but it was expensive and we had just bought a house and werent flush with cash so i waited i got a few more quotes and was ready to pull the trigger in late but then the painter told me he couldnt in good conscience take my money because most of my siding was rotted you can apparently still get the siding for minor repairs but its fairly expensive and he showed me at least four large spots where the siding sounded different and he said it was rot he told me to just replace everything painting wouldnt even buy us years because most likely the old owners painted over what was already rotting and you cant undo rot with paint i ended up getting a quote for replacement siding in mid on the order of i was like fine well save another few months and do siding plus some other exterior stuff then the pandemic hit and were like we might lose a job we luckily didnt and we waited until early signed a contract in january had a woodpecker incident in march but i didnt care because finally no more games of is this dog shit the same color as our house were good little savers so we made sure we saved for the cost of the reno plus the contingency because this isnt our first rodeo im so ready for this all projects have scope and cost creep but i know that so i make sure were budgeting for it i talk to my friends about renovations with authority because ive been there ive done that they started yesterday i meet the crew with breakfast burritos because i know how to ingratiate myself with people and because im just so damn happy to see them all chipper and happy i leave my husband to deal with the real project management while i go to work having done my part just as i pull in to my work he calls he goes theres a problem now im kind of laughing because when we redid the bathroom he greeted me with theres a leek in our bathroom and i run up there all freaked out to find a fucking leek in the fucking bathroom and him laughing his ass off i know his games so as he tells me that our sheathing is made of cardboard im only half paying attention wondering what vegetable is sheathing because it cant be that sheathing would be made of cardboard thats ludicrous what builder would do that probably the builder that went out of business for cutting so many corners like installing recalled electrical panels that dont actually flip the breaker but just go halfway causing arcing and house fires replaced in or the kind that use a single resting directly on the dirt as a support pole for the main beam because a metal pole in concrete is not worth it fixed in but cardboard sheathing no way thats not a real thing my husband and my conversation goes something like him our houses sheathing is made of cardboard me like amazon boxes him no not like amazon boxes like poster board me good because those boxes are pretty flimsy him this is not like the leek thing this is serious anyway normal sheathing is apparently made of lumber do you know what there is a major shortage of lumber for some reason my house has cardboard where there should be lumber this is also unique to my house because both my neighbors had their siding redone and i dont remember there being cardboard instead of plywood there was fucking plywood the same shitty paper siding but legit sheathing underneath they do have another house style so maybe they had a different builder than we did the best part is that in the background i can hear the project manager and foreman cursing in both english and spanish which is always reassuring the best is when i hear fuuuuuck even under the deck because i know that this means its bad why are they upset you might ask its another days of guaranteed work and they know i cant go anywhere else but they didnt count on having to sheath a house in addition to the siding and apparently a different crew does sheathing and they are doing new builds and we have the deck crew which is yet another set of people scheduled to come today to start pouring concrete for the supports but now they cant because instead they have to reroute the sheathing crew to come out and clad my house in osb so its really like an extra two weeks of my house being a trash heap because they cant get the lumber until tomorrow and they arent going to start friday afternoon because they dont work weekends so were looking at sheathing being completed monday afternoon hopefully monday days to actually put on new siding then the deck crew is already busy so well have to wait until that following monday to start on the deck and its in extra cost for me which is fun its not like i can be like nah lets call the whole thing off because theres no siding in places and theres woodpecker damage incidentally the only place where there is wood sheathing because it was added in the early aughts and its not like i can return the materials i already bought and they cant and shouldnt mount to cardboard so here i am blew through my contingency and then some within an hour of starting my project got the scope creep crept my whole schedule is now stretched from week to almost three but hey at least at the end of this i wont have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to live in a shit colored cardboard box just for your peace of mind we have the money in savings well be okay i know this isnt the end of the world but right at this moment it sure feels that way to me hope your day is better than

497,so youre panicking this is a normal thing that happens when youve made a huge lifestyle choice and it didnt turn out exactly how you thought it would this doesnt mean youve made a mistake and if it does its not the end of the world so take a breathe you will be okay try to remember that because youre freaking out you probably arent in the most rational headspace things may not be as bad as you think firstly remember nothing is permanent worst case scenario if time doesnt change your mind yes you may need to wait a bit to sell but if youre in a hot market that is probably not very long knowing that you wont permanently have to live somewhere you hate helps ease the pressure maybe you could focus on small things that would add value to the place anything desperately needing painting or fixing was the place staged well and clean when you viewed it its your place anything you can do to make it nicer to live in when i first bought my unit which is in a multi story block of units i felt the same as you wtf had i done the road was louder than i thought the place had some issues i immediately got on the wrong side of the body corp i was convinced i had made a huge mistake this feeling lasted a few months but then i decided to focus on what i could control i can try to fix any issues the place has internally to make it better to live in i got thick black out curtains and that helped with the road noise and i painted the bathroom for example make a list so you dont get overwhelmed and try knock out the easy cheap things first maybe you could buy some large rugs and put that foam sheeting stuff under them that might help with noise transfer to downstairs make sure your speakers arent too bassy as that travels more you need to be considerate of neighbours but sometimes they are unreasonable so youll need to set boundaries with them this sucks but is luck of the draw you could be renting and dealing with this as well no place is perfect and the ones that are close to it you cant afford sometimes you just have to make the best out of the situation in multi dwelling buildings people can be quite protective and suspicious of new people are they going to make my life hell through noise are they going to be unreasonable and cause problems they can get triggered by small things maybe thats whats at play here with your run ins with people they have had bad experiences with people previously and want to assert the law early on i had one guy make a million assumptions about me and what sort of neighbour id be based on very little they are scared and it can come across as quite aggressive try not to take it as personally i know its hard ive been in my place for a few years now and all the things that i thought i couldnt live with either i resolved or they became less important to me im on the committee of the body corp now and get along really well with all of them my place is nicer and cheaper than all the places my friends have to rent its gained a lot in value over the years which i wouldnt have gotten from renting its one of the best decisions ive made is it my dream house fuck no but its a good stepping stone and im happy living there sorry this is so long i remember the dread i felt and i just wanted you to know you arent alone and itll be okay,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,homeowners

503,im posting this here in the homeowner sub but this cautionary tale goes for anyone living in an inclosed space a week ago i started to have furnace troubles my furnace would not light i called the appropriate repair people and the diagnosis was that a gas valve was going bad as most of everyone knows the us is experiencing a polar vortex and i was not an exception to that i knew of a way to keep the furnace lit and it seemed safe i would just tap on the gas valve when i knew it would need to turn on and usually it would light up im cheap so instead of fixing or replacing my furnace i wanted to see what my home protection plan would cover i figured a week of this would not be horrible as sometimes it would take hours for it to repeat the failure on the same day my furnace started having problems the smoke alarm in my daughters room started acting up i removed the alarm and the alarm defect stopped that was in the morning and after work i stopped at a big box store to look for a replacement smoke detector i never realized there were so many different types and i stood in the isle wonder what i should do for some reason i had it set in my mind that i should get smoke detector and carbon monoxide combo also since my home is years old i decided i should just replace all my alarms looking at my options each detector was bucks i needed and bought packs i am notorious for putting off tasks around the house some is laziness some is i work a lot i told my wife on friday that i would get to installing the new detectors sometime usually that means in a week to months sunday was a lazy day cleaning day for my family in a break from my chores my son asked if i would install alarm hes autistic and hyper focuses on things like that and he really really wanted to hear the detectors talk since i got the talking version so i obliged him and installed one i had to remove the old wiring as it didnt match up to the new one but was much easier than expected so i decided to just install all of them in an hour and a half they were all up on a side note i found out of them were not wired into the house wiring awesome i thought as i had peace of mind that they all were new and installed properly last night my furnace was giving me more fits i decided that i was done waiting for insurance and i will pay to replace the furnace and hopefully get reimbursed if the failure was covered i finally got the furnace to light and i cranked the heat so the temp would be higher if it turned off i went to bed with out a second thought in my mind around am this morning i was awoken to the alarms beep beep beep carbon monoxide detected i sprung out of bed and flew to the basement and turned the furnace off not sure why but that was my first thought as i raced back up stairs my wife was getting my kids out of bed and dressed i was out of it having been woken up out of a amazingly deep sleep i was not in the right mind and my wife said we needed to get in our car i didnt think there was a problem but for some reason my stubborn self didnt argue we went to our garage got in the car and started warming it up with the garage door open my wife is a safely sally and demanded we call the fire department while she called i went back in to open a door and window to air the place out i made it half way up my upstairs when i hear my name bing called i hollered back but no answer i walked more steps and heard my name clearly and hollered unmistakenly loud no answer it was then i realized that there was for sure a co leak in my house and i booked it as fast as i could back outside my wife had already talked to the fire department and they said they were on their way and in minutes they showed up i told the fire fighters what was up and they entered my house in less than minutes they were back out they said they didnt even make it to my furnace when their meters were going off they cautioned me in what i should and shouldnt do we decided to stay with family for the night and left my home safely if you made it this far in my story you really dont need a summary but ill give one had i not bought combo alarms my family and i might be dead had i procrastinated on installing the smoke co alarms my family might be dead had i not followed my wifes lead we all might be dead had i wanted to save some money and bought cheaper alarms we all might be dead honestly it was the best bucks ive ever spent and the alarms have already paid for themself if your alarms are old look into replacing them if you dont have co alarms get one for every floor thanks for reading and stay safe in this frigid weather tldr i installed smoke co alarms on sunday last night the co alarm went off from a bad furnace likely saving me and my familys lives,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,homeowners

505,original post i found the fence on thursday saturday i was having about a dozen people over for a family birthday party so the eyesore of a fence had to go one way or another so on friday morning i had a follow up call with the realtor who knew nothing about the fence and he told me that the homeowner didnt either i called my neighborhood civil council president to let him know about it and he told me about encroachment issues as the fence was on my property but also let me know that in my city a permit is not required to build this type of fence i took many commenters advice and installed security cameras around my house two of which have either full or partial view of the neighboring backyard i also took to heart the idea that there may be squatters living or preparing to live in the house next door if i find anything on my security cameras indicating there may be squatters ill be informing the police so on friday afternoon i removed the fencing in its multiple different pieces and gently leaned them against the brick garage with the exception of one door sized section which i put against the basement door in case there are indeed squatters entering through there saturday sunday and monday came and went without any indication that the yard was entered again and the fencing over the basement door hasnt moved we still dont know who built the fence or why but it doesnt seem like anyone cares and at least now i dont have an abomination of a fence to stare at anymore i will likely build my own fence though one that looks good and is structurally sound and that spans my property line thanks to everyone for your input and advice and if i learn who built the fence i will be sure to update again,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,homeowners

515,you bought a geiger counter and now you have no idea what it tells you so you measured something like cps is for example an air radon level that is not concerning and associated with a higher risk of lung cancer even outside air can have up to just from the natural radon but granite isnt radon in the air without knowing if it is alpha bravo or gamma radiation and its actual energy and direction all you know is that there is some elevated activity from your countertop to make it more understandable the geiger counter counts shots but you only know the number you dont know if an airsoft gun or a bazooka is shooting and more importantly if the shots are directed at you what you would actually need is a dosimeter as what you need to measure is sievert sievert is the actual equivalent dose the energy absorbed by your body without knowing sieverts it is not possible to tell if your measurement is actually concerning or totally harmless if you want to do a fun experiment put a piece of cardboard over the black streak and see if you still get a reading if not it is likely an alpha emitter and alpha particles can be shielded with a piece of cardboard as they are too large to penetrate the cardboard and hence totally harmless unless you eat or inhale your granite as the dead top level of your skin will absorb alpha radiation this might show you how complex this topic is and that you cant just conclude for the geiger count if there is an actual risk or not,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,homeowners

575,my husband and i bought our first house back in april and knew that since it was built in the it could probably be more energy efficient but figured wed put off those types of issues until wed gotten some other projects squared away now that its colder out we noticed the house is pretty drafty and way too humid our electric company has a home energy audit program so we had them over on the to check things out well wouldnt you know it they told us our water heater was leaking we had no idea we arent down there often and hadnt noticed a leak before but sure enough there was a small puddle behind it and the tiles near it squish when you step on them great the previous owner left the manual for the water heater and when i checked it to try and figure out how old the thing was i saw a year manufacturer warranty on the back the warranty said if it leaked they would replace it for free but theres no way this thing is still under warranty right so i check out the unit and find out its a but theres no installation date and the warranty is for years from install my husband called customer support but the guy thought we were talking about a home warranty or something and just kept repeating that we didnt have one it wasnt covered etc suuuuuuper helpful i used the companys chat feature the next day the to try and figure out if they had any record of when the water heater was installed and the woman there was really helpful she found out the water heater was installed on october it had one day left on the warranty we had an appointment with a repairman yesterday and he agreed that the water heater should be replaced he called someone and was like is this really still under warranty and they told him it was so now well be getting a new water heater the repairman also said water heaters are normally installed with a drip pan and something to cut down on the water pressure between the well pump and the heater we had neither so well be getting those too were so excited to have it replaced for just the cost of labor and feel so lucky that the home energy auditors pointed it out to us when they did we definitely wouldnt have noticed the water heater until it was out of warranty then wed have to pay for it ourselves now im impatiently waiting for the company to call us back and give us the date of the repair until then well just have to keep walking down there to mop up and change out the rags we left to collect any dripping water the leak isnt awful yet were just hoping it doesnt get any worse before they can replace it,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,homeowners

580,always always always get multiple inspections and bids from different contractors you never know if someones trying to bamboozle you were currently in the process of selling our existing home and the buyer had the roof inspected they brought in someone from a reputable company and his report came back showing extensive hail and wind damage as well as significant age related problems and his recommendation was immediate replacement of the entire roof he felt that repair wouldnt last long and it wouldnt be worth the time or money as a result the buyers wanted us to replace the roof or knock off the price of the house we filed an insurance claim due to the hail and wind damage the insurance adjuster disagreed with the roofers evaluation and two other roofers we brought in for estimates disagreed with it as well and felt that the roof is in excellent condition for its age and just needs a couple of minor repairs they all felt the wind damage was minimal and there was no hail damage that effected the integrity of the roof and that it still has several years left before it needs to be replaced we happen to be friends with the owners of the roofing company that the buyers used so we contacted them to find out what was going on when they went to look up our file they could not locate our names or address in their system which it should have been since their company was used they sent out another employee to inspect our roof and his evaluation was the same as all the others we received from the people we brought in turns out the inspector was best friends with the buyers against company policy he did the inspection has a side gig as a favor for his friends the buyers had already haggled us on our asking price and we had dropped the price significantly but they werent satisfied and wanted to swindle us out of more they opted to do it that way instead of trying to negotiate with us our friends who own the roofing company guard their reputation jealously and told us that the employee faced the worst possible consequences were assuming he got fired initially we assumed that the buyers inspection report was legitimate because we know the owners and the excellent reputation of the company they used it never occurred to us that their employee was colluding with the buyers and we could be victims of a scam tdlr even if you know youre dealing with a reputable company always get a second opinion bids on any work that may need to be done on your house you never know if someone is trying to rip you off edited for additional thoughts ive calmed down some and have a more even head to contemplate the whole thing the short answer to legal recourse for those interested is they can argue it was done in good faith the roofer that wrote the report can argue that in his professional judgement the roof needed replacing immediately just because he disagrees with the other inspections doesnt legally discount his evaluation we would also have to prove there was collusion just the connection with them being friends is purely cicumstantial its enough that he faced the consequences from his employer for violating the terms of his employment which expressly forbade side jobs for just this reason the fact he did the inspection under the auspices of doing business on their behalf by showing up in his company truck and sending the report from his company email didnt help his cause furthering the case for the consequences he faced when we reviewed his emailed report aside from his company email address he scrubbed all contact info for the company and listed his private number to call if we had any questions take what you will from that tidbit but still not enough to prove he had malicious intent the buyers backed out and were back on the market,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,homeowners

586,when our last american brand dishwasher self immolated in we went to our local appliance store and ultimately decided on a miele model replacement its considered a premium brand and indeed it was pretty nice in terms of features we have kids and try to cook frequently and avoid disposables so we produce a good amount of dirty dishes weve used the miele pretty much daily since we bought it up until the past couple weeks i would have honestly given it high marks and considered buying from the brand again well a week ago the unit seems to have died suddenly filled the cabinet went to turn it on and its just dead no power no lights nada circuit breaker is fine definitely annoying but hey stuff happens to appliances now and then right i called miele customer service and they opened a support ticket with their regional repair company that they work with i was told theyd call within the next couple days to set up the appointment a few days go by and nothing so i call the repair company directly the first person tells me their office doesnt serve my area call some other number i call the other number the person who answers says they have no record of my work order ok fine call miele support a second time and the person i speak to this time says the work order was cancelled for some reason lets open another one so we do this time i try to get ahead of things by calling the repair company again im told they dont have a work order for me but even if they did they dont support my area i call miele yet again and my work order was once again mysteriously closed with no notice its pretty clear at this point that the repair outfit miele contracts with just doesnt want to come to my zip code but its infuriating that the way this is handled is by stealth closing the work orders without any notice at all for what its worth were in a burb of a major metro area i guess you could call it a blue collar area so its not the part where all the rich people with high end appliances live but its still a major metro area not exactly a dirt farm in the middle of nowhere anyway its becoming pretty clear the miele direct support thing isnt working out and i just want the damn dish washer to work again so i go and google local appliance repair outfits theres a well reviewed one not too far away and they list miele on their website so i put in a request with them not long after i get a call from a guy at this company saying hes very sorry but they cant work on miele stuff any more miele cut their parts distributor off from getting replacement parts they miele want everyone to go to miele support directly fucking hell and this pretty much brings us up to today at this point the issue is still unresolved but its starting to look like a new non miele dishwasher is my only hope the current one is only years old but apparently miele makes their products unserviceable and are unable or unwilling to provide their own service unless you live in very very specific zip codes what a joke completely changed my opinion of the brand,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,homeowners

598,i think most of the problem is with private companies and incredibly rich individuals owning large portions of private homes apartments i dont think anyone is really hating on the mom and pop with rentals that keeps up on the property and is responsive the fact of the matter is not everyone wants to buy a home there needs to be options for those people and as long as youre being reasonable about rent and stuff i dont see a problem,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,homeowners
