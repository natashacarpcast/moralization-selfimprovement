       "82584  i genuinely  disagree  with the opinion in some ways red pill helps be more attractive to womenmy belief is that sometimes  there are things that make  no sense like the man should  never split a bill or cheating on your woman for example  but i believe  as a concept  red pill is the most healthy  because  blue pill helps  no one black pill  gives no hope being a former red pilled guy its helped me get girls more than anything i could  be an exception but it teaches  discipline  and  responsibility unlike the other  three my opinion  is its not always  your fault ive experienced  a time when i was a victim and i was wrong saying 100 percent  is wrong id say 80 or 70 percent i think some red pill teachings are great  like be consistentbe confident improve yourself lately  since leaving  ive  been  trying  to find  my own way so im trying  to say the woman  can be the problem  and saying  to take 100 percent  accountability is wrong  because  some  behaviors  that women have  are unacceptable and even if its his fault we need to further  help  both sexes because  i feel  we lack understanding  of eachother  and  because  of that lack  of understanding  we attack  one another  by being tricked and conditioned to hate  one another                                                                            edit i want  to let you know  i appreciate  your opinion and i love  hearing  others opinions i just wanted  to share mine from being in that space   \n",
