       "      <td>what does it mean to have a growth mindset  a growth mindset as first introduced by stanford psychologist carol dweck in her book mindset the new psychology of success refers to the belief that ones abilities and intelligence can be developed and improved through effort and learning this differs from a fixed mindset where individuals believe that their abilities and intelligence are fixed and cannot be changed  dwecks research has shown that individuals with a growth mindset tend to be more successful and experience greater skill development as they are more open to challenges learning from mistakes and persevering in the face of setbacks they understand that failure is a natural part of the learning process and use it as an opportunity for growth  on the other hand those with a fixed mindset may shy away from challenges and view mistakes as a reflection of their inherent abilities they tend to believe that success comes naturally to some people and not to others rather than recognizing that it is the result of hard work and dedication   uncovering the truth a closer look at the growth mindset  there seems to be a degree of confusion among some individuals regarding the true meaning of the growth mindset theory in order to provide a more clear understanding it is important to address and dispel any misconceptions surrounding the concept additionally a discussion of the research findings and realities that stem from dwecks work will be provided      separating fact from fiction clearing up misconceptions about growth mindset  when it comes to understanding the concept of growth and fixed mindsets its natural to want to assign ourselves to one or the other however this oversimplifies the idea of our mindset as it is not a binary concept with only two choices in reality most individuals possess a combination of both growth and fixed mindsets and our mindset exists on a spectrum its important to recognize that our mindset can change and evolve over time and with effort      an organization can possess a mindset  one of the misconceptions surrounding a growth mindset culture is the belief that organizations themselves can possess a specific mindset while leaders may claim that their organization embodies a growth mindset it is important to remember that organizations are composed of individuals each with their own unique mindset while an organization can encourage and promote the development of growth mindsets among its members as part of its culture it cannot truly possess a growth mindset as it is not an individual entity its crucial for leaders and employees to understand that a growth mindset is a personal attribute and its the individuals within the organization that can develop and possess it      a growth mindset is the same as a positive mindset  another common misconception is that a growth mindset is synonymous with having a positive attitude while a positive attitude can certainly be beneficial a growth mindset goes beyond this it is about embracing the idea that ones abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort and practice rather than being fixed traits its a belief in the potential for growth and the understanding that learning and improvement come through hard work and perseverance not just innate talent in short a growth mindset is not just about thinking positively its about taking action to develop oneself and ones abilities   the misconception of automatic positive results with a growth mindset  its a common misconception that having a growth mindset automatically leads to positive outcomes while its true that a growth mindset can be a powerful tool for personal and professional development its not a magic bullet that guarantees success factors such as motivation commitment and effort also play important roles a person with a fixed mindset can also achieve success a growth mindset is an attitude and a belief but it needs to be coupled with the motivation to improve putting in the time and effort to develop a skill and a commitment to personal growth to drive positive results its essential to understand that a growth mindset is not just a mindset but a journey of continuous improvement learning and progress      understanding the realities of a growth mindset  with the misconceptions cleared its time to examine the four key realities of a growth mindset      navigating the gray area  when analyzing the mindsets of students professor carol dweck found that most individuals do not fit neatly into a binary classification of having a growth or fixed mindset instead most people possess a combination of both with varying degrees of emphasis on one or the other for example a student may believe that their math skills can be improved through effort and practice but also believe that their reading and writing abilities are innate this is true not only in the classroom but also in the workplace most people fall on a spectrum between growth and fixed mindsets this complexity of mindset is something that is important to consider when looking at individuals and organizations      growth mindset understanding the complexities beyond effort  carol dweck a leading researcher on growth mindsets has observed that many individuals including leaders and educators tend to equate a growth mindset with simply putting in more effort however this oversimplification can lead to what dweck calls a false growth mindset effort is certainly an important aspect of a growth mindset but it is not the only one a crucial component is the individuals attitude towards learning new things and their perception of failure as a natural part of the learning process a growth mindset is more complex than just trying harder its about embracing challenges learning from mistakes and being open to feedback and improvement to truly develop a growth mindset its important to understand that its not just about putting in effort but also about changing our attitude towards learning and progress   not everyone can achieve everything  individuals may have limitations but a growth mindset intervention can help them work through and overcome them however its important to note that some limitations may still be insurmountable for example a persons physical height may prevent them from reaching certain goals such as becoming a professional basketball player in the wnba      achieving success through a growth mindset and persistent effort  individuals who possess a growth mindset understand that progress and improvement are possible regardless of their current abilities or circumstances to achieve success they adopt key principles such as viewing failure as a learning opportunity embracing challenges and developing new strategies to overcome obstacles without a growth mindset and a willingness to put in the time and effort achieving ones goals may prove difficult in short a growth mindset is essential for positive results but it must be paired with consistent and dedicated effort to truly make an impact   how to develop a growth mindset 13 tips  now that weve discussed the

       "      <td>my boy marcus has all the best mantras to repeat to oneself in times of reflection and need really dig the words you listed one of my favorites of his from meditations is written in my bathroom i taped it up to my mirror to repeat it to myself every day  the soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts   its such a powerful little quip that resonates deeply in me in each moment we have the inescapable choice in how we react to external stimulus whether it be through deeply engrained familiar patterns that we dont even notice or emotionmotivated response i am surely no master of this choice but it truly helps to reflect on that power balance between our inner selves and the outside influence we allow in and if we choose to allow negative thoughts to fester within our minds well that never ends in mental peace and happiness the soul becomes burdened with the negativity we allow it to bear   i think the true power that lies in stoic philosophy and existential philosophy as well  is its unfaltering devotion to that constant choice it is our responsibility as sentient beings to actively participate in the flow and perception of our lives by charging forward with an endless series of decisions how we choose to react to others how we choose to react to the thoughts inside our mind which are not you how we choose to frame a situation   it is our choices that show us who we truly are far more than our abilities  virtue in the eyes of the stoic was repeated habitual good behavior and acts that was happiness you are so habitually familiar with  choosing the best thoughts best reactions to stimuli for yourself that it hardly feels like a choice at all</td>\n",

understanding that comes through experiment and selfknowledge brings confidence  this confidence may be called faith it is not the faith of the foolish it is not faith in something this confidence or faith of which i am speaking comes through experimentation in selfknowledge not through acceptance and hope the selfconfidence that many have is the outcome of ignorance of achievement of selfglory or of capacity   the confidence of which i speak is understanding not the i understand but understanding without selfidentification  confidence comes into being it cannot be manufactured by the mind confidence comes with experiment and discovery not the experiment with belief theory or memory but experimentation with selfknowledge this confidence or faith is not selfimposed nor is it identified

in the realm of spiritual understanding the root cause of all fear can be traced back to a fundamental illusionthe illusion of separateness at the core of human experience there exists a profound interconnectedness a oneness that transcends the boundaries of individual identities        fear arises when the ego the sense of a separate self becomes dominant and perceives itself as isolated from the rest of existence this illusion of separateness breeds fear of the unknown fear of losing what we identify with and fear of not being in control        in truth we are not isolated beings but interconnected threads in the vast tapestry of existence the fear of separation creates a sense of vulnerability and the ego seeks to protect itself through various meansattachment control and resistance however these very defenses often perpetuate the cycle of fear        to transcend fear one must embark on a journey of selfdiscovery and realization of the interconnected nature of all things through practices such as meditation selfreflection and cultivating compassion one can begin to dissolve the illusion of separateness as this illusion fades fear loses its grip and a profound sense of peace and unity emerges        embracing the present moment releasing attachments and understanding the impermanence of the material world are keys to unlocking the door to freedom from fear by recognizing the oneness that underlies all existence we can navigate the challenges of life with courage acceptance and love        remember the journey to conquer fear is not about suppressing or eliminating it but understanding its root and transcending it through a deep connection to the eternal and interconnected nature of our existence   \n",

whenever you feel powerless you can restore your sense of self and return to your natural state of empowerment by remembering and using your power  you have the power to learn  this power is like a magic wand because when you learn from a painful or negative experience you change that experience into something valuable  you can apply this power at the time of an event or you can apply it laterthe effect is the same  choosing to learn from a negative view of reality transforms it into an asset a giftsomething that happened to you becomes an experience you own  this power contributes to your sense of selfworth because there is value in learning  choosing to learn can ease painit is the best distraction  when you shift your focus from feeling pain to discovering what you can learn from a painful situation you begin to remove yourself from the grip of that pain and set yourself free  learning keeps you from being a helpless victimit gives you something constructive to do and that gives you power  you have the power to learn  you have the power to choose  choice is the mechanism that determines how you change and grow  when you are in a familiar situation following a familiar path at any point you can choose to act or react differently or go in a new direction  you can choose to listen rather than talk smile rather than frown let go rather than hold on to something that does not serve you forgive rather than resent  you can choose to look beyond behavioryour own or anyone elsesto be aware of the soul behind that behavior  choice is an expression of your free will  you can choose to live a becoming life in which you become the kind of person you want to be  every choice is important even if it seems small  choices add up to changes  you have the power to choose  you have the power to be happy  if you decide to be happy no one can stop you  if you decide to be unhappy no one can make you be happy  its up to you  you have the power to love  love is the greatest power of all  you can transcend any force any fear any block any loss by loving  you can transform anything in your life beginning with yourself by loving  love is the ultimate lesson the ultimate achievement the ultimate resource and the ultimate goal of every soul  when you love you elevate yourself as well as everything around you by the energy level of that state  love

    throughout history various philosophical schools of thought have emerged and been widely accepted but undoubtedly one of the most intriguing and practical of these is stoicism which originated in ancient greece around the 3rd century bc  stoicism is a philosophical school that believes in the virtues of selfcontrol rationality and inner peace the practical aspects of stoicism emphasize personal responsibility emotional control and resilience as well as the importance of living in harmony with the natural world  the philosopher zeno of citium founded the stoic school in athens in the 3rd century bc and it went through several changes over the centuries however its core philosophy remained the same emphasizing the rationality of individuals and their ability to control their emotions and actions  the stoic philosophy emphasizes three crucial values that one must attain to live a fulfilling life wisdom courage and moderation wisdom is the process of gaining knowledge and developing critical thinking skills to navigate through life courage involves standing up for what you believe in and facing the challenges of life headon moderation is the ability to control impulses and maintain balance in all aspects of ones life  furthermore the philosophy emphasizes the importance of not getting swept away by external events but rather building up the inner resilience that allows one to face any challenges that may arise  one powerful technique stoics use to develop their resilience is taking a negative visualization approach they imagine the worst possible scenario that could occur in a given situation and prepare themselves to face it this technique allows them to develop detachment from what is out of their control and focus only on what they can influence  another critical aspect of stoicism is the belief that ones interpretation of events is more influential than the events themselves they believe that by changing ones perspective one can transform their experiences they focus on maintaining a positive outlook even when faced with challenging situations  finally the stoic philosophy teaches one not to fear death but to accept it as a natural process of life it emphasizes that one should not fear death but rather live life to the fullest while one still has the opportunity  in conclusion stoicism is more than just a philosophy it is a way of life that can help individuals navigate the challenges of daily life by providing them with practical tools to develop inner resilience emotional control and clarity of mind whether dealing with the hardships of the past or the uncertainties of the future stoicism can offer an essential perspective that can help one make peace with oneself and the world   \n",

its comprehension development and fluidity are so hard to pin down and understand i felt it would be good to offer my newly formed definition of confidence my feeling is that if you want to build your confidence then its important to first understand all of its components once you have mapped out the entirety of what confidence entails you can work on improving it from a framework that wont fail at a certain level of analysis or upon encountering something unexpected i frequently experience people using a superficial definition of confidence which has the potential to lead to feelings of disappointment frustration and hopelessness im hopeful that my definition of confidence can provide people with an expanded view of everything involved in having confidence and enable them to move towards a selfimproved state with a better understanding of their own circumstances and emotions  without further ado heres my definition of confidence  confidence is derived from an understanding and acknowledgment of ones inherent value as an individual via ones effective capacity andor selfassurance in ones ability to attain effective capacity to successfully abstract and manipulate ones circumstances to achieve a substantive desired outcome confidence is fluid  it is affected by ones recognition of past experiences past rate of success vs failure the perceived level of ones current capabilities and the anticipated potential of ones effective capacity in the future confidence is diminished or bolstered through the constant evaluation of ones perceived capabilities relative to the perceived capabilities of others especially in regards to the conceptualized difficulty of achieving the selected desired outcome and through ones assessment of the extent to which ones perceptions of their circumstances and capabilities are accurate ie if your lens through which you view the world turns out to be lacking in some way confidence can be weakened whereas if your lens turns out to be accurate or accurate enough confidence can be strengthened   thanks and im looking forward to discussing this framework further  michael a nahan   \n",

       "70590   what does it mean to have a growth mindset  a growth mindset as first introduced by stanford psychologist carol dweck in her book mindset the new psychology of success refers to the belief that ones abilities and intelligence can be developed and improved through effort and learning this differs from a fixed mindset where individuals believe that their abilities and intelligence are fixed and cannot be changed  dwecks research has shown that individuals with a growth mindset tend to be more successful and experience greater skill development as they are more open to challenges learning from mistakes and persevering in the face of setbacks they understand that failure is a natural part of the learning process and use it as an opportunity for growth  on the other hand those with a fixed mindset may shy away from challenges and view mistakes as a reflection of their inherent abilities they tend to believe that success comes naturally to some people and not to others rather than recognizing that it is the result of hard work and dedication   uncovering the truth a closer look at the growth mindset  there seems to be a degree of confusion among some individuals regarding the true meaning of the growth mindset theory in order to provide a more clear understanding it is important to address and dispel any misconceptions surrounding the concept additionally a discussion of the research findings and realities that stem from dwecks work will be provided      separating fact from fiction clearing up misconceptions about growth mindset  when it comes to understanding the concept of growth and fixed mindsets its natural to want to assign ourselves to one or the other however this oversimplifies the idea of our mindset as it is not a binary concept with only two choices in reality most individuals possess a combination of both growth and fixed mindsets and our mindset exists on a spectrum its important to recognize that our mindset can change and evolve over time and with effort      an organization can possess a mindset  one of the misconceptions surrounding a growth mindset culture is the belief that organizations themselves can possess a specific mindset while leaders may claim that their organization embodies a growth mindset it is important to remember that organizations are composed of individuals each with their own unique mindset while an organization can encourage and promote the development of growth mindsets among its members as part of its culture it cannot truly possess a growth mindset as it is not an individual entity its crucial for leaders and employees to understand that a growth mindset is a personal attribute and its the individuals within the organization that can develop and possess it      a growth mindset is the same as a positive mindset  another common misconception is that a growth mindset is synonymous with having a positive attitude while a positive attitude can certainly be beneficial a growth mindset goes beyond this it is about embracing the idea that ones abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort and practice rather than being fixed traits its a belief in the potential for growth and the understanding that learning and improvement come through hard work and perseverance not just innate talent in short a growth mindset is not just about thinking positively its about taking action to develop oneself and ones abilities   the misconception of automatic positive results with a growth mindset  its a common misconception that having a growth mindset automatically leads to positive outcomes while its true that a growth mindset can be a powerful tool for personal and professional development its not a magic bullet that guarantees success factors such as motivation commitment and effort also play important roles a person with a fixed mindset can also achieve success a growth mindset is an attitude and a belief but it needs to be coupled with the motivation to improve putting in the time and effort to develop a skill and a commitment to personal growth to drive positive results its essential to understand that a growth mindset is not just a mindset but a journey of continuous improvement learning and progress      understanding the realities of a growth mindset  with the misconceptions cleared its time to examine the four key realities of a growth mindset      navigating the gray area  when analyzing the mindsets of students professor carol dweck found that most individuals do not fit neatly into a binary classification of having a growth or fixed mindset instead most people possess a combination of both with varying degrees of emphasis on one or the other for example a student may believe that their math skills can be improved through effort and practice but also believe that their reading and writing abilities are innate this is true not only in the classroom but also in the workplace most people fall on a spectrum between growth and fixed mindsets this complexity of mindset is something that is important to consider when looking at individuals and organizations      growth mindset understanding the complexities beyond effort  carol dweck a leading researcher on growth mindsets has observed that many individuals including leaders and educators tend to equate a growth mindset with simply putting in more effort however this oversimplification can lead to what dweck calls a false growth mindset effort is certainly an important aspect of a growth mindset but it is not the only one a crucial component is the individuals attitude towards learning new things and their perception of failure as a natural part of the learning process a growth mindset is more complex than just trying harder its about embracing challenges learning from mistakes and being open to feedback and improvement to truly develop a growth mindset its important to understand that its not just about putting in effort but also about changing our attitude towards learning and progress   not everyone can achieve everything  individuals may have limitations but a growth mindset intervention can help them work through and overcome them however its important to note that some limitations may still be insurmountable for example a persons physical height may prevent them from reaching certain goals such as becoming a professional basketball player in the wnba      achieving success through a growth mindset and persistent effort  individuals who possess a growth mindset understand that progress and improvement are possible regardless of their current abilities or circumstances to achieve success they adopt key principles such as viewing failure as a learning opportunity embracing challenges and developing new strategies to overcome obstacles without a growth mindset and a willingness to put in the time and effort achieving ones goals may prove difficult in short a growth mindset is essential for positive results but it must be paired with consistent and dedicated effort to truly make an impact   how to develop a growth mindset 13 tips  now that weve discussed the

landscapes my lifes tapestry is woven with memories that have defined my existence        from the sands of desert storm where i served my nation as a military veteran to the digital landscapes of computer programming where ive honed my skills for over four decades ive lived a life rich in experiences and passions        today as i find myself facing new challenges living as a homeless veteran in a shelter i reflect on the memories that have shaped mememories of love laughter and the joy of being a father to a remarkable daughter and let the power of good memories elevate me past my woes to face those challenges before me        in the midst of lifes trials and tribulations i hold close the knowledge that memories are the only thing we carry when we reach the end of this beautiful journey on our deathbed it is not the possessions weve amassed or the titles weve earned that linger its the cherished memories of the moments that truly mattered        in a world so diverse it matters not whether we are rich or poor of different races or religions or even whether weve walked the path of a saint or an evildoer our memories hold the key to what truly defines the life we have lived        no matter our circumstances we all have the power to craft beautiful moments that become the legacy we leave behind these moments are not limited by material wealth or social status they are the treasures we carry in the depths of our hearts        let us remember that every day is an opportunity to create something special to touch lives and to make a positive impact we have the power to paint the canvas of our lives with the strokes of love compassion and joy leaving behind a beautiful masterpiece of memories        though my lifes journey may have taken unexpected turns i find solace in the realization that i can still create beautiful memories finding joy in even the simplest gestures and connections  its in the smallest gestures the shared laughter the acts of kindness and the connections we forge that we create the most cherished memories these memories become the beacon of light guiding us toward the essence of a life that mattered        so my friends no matter where life takes us lets remember that memories know no boundariesthey are the true measure of a good life lets strive to fill our days with moments of love kindness and genuine human connection for it is in these memories that we discover the essence of our existence        in the end it is not the external labels that matter it is the sum of our memories that will whisper to us if we have lived a good life lets cherish every opportunity to create a good memory for it is in these precious moments that we discover the true essence of our existence   \n",

                                                        my boy marcus has all the best mantras to repeat to oneself in times of reflection and need really dig the words you listed one of my favorites of his from meditations is written in my bathroom i taped it up to my mirror to repeat it to myself every day  the soul becomes dyed with the color of its thoughts   its such a powerful little quip that resonates deeply in me in each moment we have the inescapable choice in how we react to external stimulus whether it be through deeply engrained familiar patterns that we dont even notice or emotionmotivated response i am surely no master of this choice but it truly helps to reflect on that power balance between our inner selves and the outside influence we allow in and if we choose to allow negative thoughts to fester within our minds well that never ends in mental peace and happiness the soul becomes burdened with the negativity we allow it to bear   i think the true power that lies in stoic philosophy and existential philosophy as well  is its unfaltering devotion to that constant choice it is our responsibility as sentient beings to actively participate in the flow and perception of our lives by charging forward with an endless series of decisions how we choose to react to others how we choose to react to the thoughts inside our mind which are not you how we choose to frame a situation   it is our choices that show us who we truly are far more than our abilities  virtue in the eyes of the stoic was repeated habitual good behavior and acts that was happiness you are so habitually familiar with  choosing the best thoughts best reactions to stimuli for yourself that it hardly feels like a choice at all   \n",

youre on marked by past actions and their consequences resonates with the universal process of growth and selfawareness its important to recognize that the path towards understanding and change is not linear nor is it free from discomfort        firstly the emotions youre grappling with  guilt from past actions and the current state of social anxiety  are signposts indicating areas within yourself that need attention and care your actions in the past while regrettable are a part of your growth journey its crucial to acknowledge that everyone makes mistakes and these experiences however painful are opportunities for learning and transformation        the feeling of not deserving to improve is a manifestation of a deeper possibly subconscious belief about your selfworth its a common reaction to internalize negative experiences and let them shape our selfimage however this selfimage as the dualistic unity perspective suggests is not the absolute reality of who you are its a constructed identity influenced by past experiences and societal narratives        heres a suggestion for a starting point begin by accepting your current state with all its complexities and discomforts acceptance doesnt mean approval or resignation but acknowledging the reality of your feelings and experiences this acceptance is a step towards releasing the grip of past actions and their emotional weight        next consider exploring the roots of your feelings  both your past actions and your present state of social anxiety this introspection can help you understand the source of these emotions and how your attachment to selfidentity  both as a bully and as a victim of your circumstances  is influencing your current state        remember the process of change and selfimprovement is not about reaching a state of perfection its about growing in selfawareness learning to navigate life with empathy and understanding for both yourself and others        as for practical steps you might find it helpful to listen to the dualistic unity podcast episode titled the practice of growth from season 4 episode 2 this episode delves into the themes of selfreflection the journey of understanding ones experiences and the beauty of human growth and change        lastly its important to be patient with yourself learning to forgive yourself to see your worth and to transform your experiences into positive growth is a journey that takes time and effort remember you are not alone in this journey and there is always potential for change and growth   \n",

       "247640  firstly this mentioned study has failed to be replicated making it very insignificant   gtstudies on the relationship between plasma testosterone levels and human sexual activity  an increase of elevated free testosterone might not translate to any actual benefits though and the relationship between nofap and testosterone is full of ambivalent science  for example   gt social modulation or hormonal causation linkages of testosterone with sexual activity and relationship quality in a nationally representative longitudinal sample of older adults on ncbi  says that older adults who masturbate more have higher testosterone levels  gtyour body uses energy to make new sperm and recycle sperm  bro your body uses energy constantly to rebuild every cell in your body even making neurotransmitters that give you  a feeling of energy requires the brain to make and create these neurotransmitters any energy loss from this is insignificant    gtdopamine   based off studies from sex addicts they are more sensitive not less to arousal which is the opposite of a drug addict and the opposite of what nofappers claim  there is no desensitization in sex addicts the exact opposite the neurochemicals are more sensitized  while this is a secondary source its still reputable  gtyour brain on porn its not addictive  gtmasturbating causes fatigue for me  i honestly believe the vast majority of nofappers have undiagnosed postorgasmic illness syndrome because the things they describe after orgasm are not normal  it could also be a case of placebo effect or a self fulfilling prophecy where the shame and guilt of having relapsed drains them of their energy and causes physical effects  for me it just makes me less horny and thats it no real affect on mood beyond that   \n",

       "      <td>some of you out there may think video games are a waste of time that they are bad for you and you should stop playing them immediately im here to say that thats wrong and that video games can actually be good 1 video games can help your brain thats right video games particularly action strategy and horror games can help stimulate many different parts of your brain including your memory focus critical thinking strategy making creativity reaction time visual memory awareness and even some languages i even learned a small amount of history from some video games video games can really help you with your studys in fact a research study showed that kids who play video games in moderation perform better then kids who dont 2 its important to play video games in moderation its very important to play video games in moderation as much as i love video games i always spend more time with my family and try to get everything i need to do done i recommend that   you should play about 1 to 2 hours a day and every once and a while if you got everything done and its a weekend then you can play a little longer but only as a special treat every once and a while their are many ways to manage an addiction without quitting entirely what i do is play for 2 hours and once im done shut the computer off and do something else try to do something else that interests you such as books hiking etc their are many ways to manage an adddiction 3 video games are art i know some of you may roll your eyes at this but its true video games are an art form they can have storys just as good as movies and even books another thing that makes video games are is the gameplay yes the gameplay you doubt me here i will explain to you why people work on video games just as hard as any movie or book and once they are done people marvel at the gameplay of a video game just like the story of a book or movie just because it dosent have a story dosent mean its not art and video games are definetly higher quality then some painting some random dude made thats not even any good yes not all video games are good but not all books or movies are good either i think two prime examples of why video games are art are cuphead by studio mdhr and papers please by lucas pope cuphead is a same whos graphics are modelled or of cartoons in the 1930s fun fact  every graphic of the game and the animations are completely hand drawn papers please is set in the soviet like fictional county of arzostokia you are a border guard tasked with checking peoples passports and deciding whether or not to allow them into the country not only is it very realistic border guard simulator but it has a really good story and it can also really question your morals in one instance in papers please a woman is travelling to see her boyfriend which is actually another border guard  but does not have the correct passport information once you question her she begs you to let her through if you let her through then she will be reunited with her boyfriend but your pay will be docked good story elements like this is what makes papers please and other video games art so the next time someone tells you the video games are nonsence and you should stop playing them show them this post and also spread the word show this post on different socail media and show it to your friends because video games are something amazing ive read tons of books and watched alot of movies but video games were always my favorite art form and thats honestly why i wanna become a game developer when i grow up some like i said before dont let anybody tell you that video games are bad because when played in moderation video games are something truly amazing like i heard some person say books tell you the story movies show you the story in video games you are in the story gameon</td>\n",

       "72055   some of you out there may think video games are a waste of time that they are bad for you and you should stop playing them immediately im here to say that thats wrong and that video games can actually be good 1 video games can help your brain thats right video games particularly action strategy and horror games can help stimulate many different parts of your brain including your memory focus critical thinking strategy making creativity reaction time visual memory awareness and even some languages i even learned a small amount of history from some video games video games can really help you with your studys in fact a research study showed that kids who play video games in moderation perform better then kids who dont 2 its important to play video games in moderation its very important to play video games in moderation as much as i love video games i always spend more time with my family and try to get everything i need to do done i recommend that   you should play about 1 to 2 hours a day and every once and a while if you got everything done and its a weekend then you can play a little longer but only as a special treat every once and a while their are many ways to manage an addiction without quitting entirely what i do is play for 2 hours and once im done shut the computer off and do something else try to do something else that interests you such as books hiking etc their are many ways to manage an adddiction 3 video games are art i know some of you may roll your eyes at this but its true video games are an art form they can have storys just as good as movies and even books another thing that makes video games are is the gameplay yes the gameplay you doubt me here i will explain to you why people work on video games just as hard as any movie or book and once they are done people marvel at the gameplay of a video game just like the story of a book or movie just because it dosent have a story dosent mean its not art and video games are definetly higher quality then some painting some random dude made thats not even any good yes not all video games are good but not all books or movies are good either i think two prime examples of why video games are art are cuphead by studio mdhr and papers please by lucas pope cuphead is a same whos graphics are modelled or of cartoons in the 1930s fun fact  every graphic of the game and the animations are completely hand drawn papers please is set in the soviet like fictional county of arzostokia you are a border guard tasked with checking peoples passports and deciding whether or not to allow them into the country not only is it very realistic border guard simulator but it has a really good story and it can also really question your morals in one instance in papers please a woman is travelling to see her boyfriend which is actually another border guard  but does not have the correct passport information once you question her she begs you to let her through if you let her through then she will be reunited with her boyfriend but your pay will be docked good story elements like this is what makes papers please and other video games art so the next time someone tells you the video games are nonsence and you should stop playing them show them this post and also spread the word show this post on different socail media and show it to your friends because video games are something amazing ive read tons of books and watched alot of movies but video games were always my favorite art form and thats honestly why i wanna become a game developer when i grow up some like i said before dont let anybody tell you that video games are bad because when played in moderation video games are something truly amazing like i heard some person say books tell you the story movies show you the story in video games you are in the story gameon   \n",

                            actually pay intention in high school and do well so i could have gotten into a good college or do running start college courses while in high school by not doing well in high school i paid the price of wasting time and money on remedial classes at a community college before i started college accredited courses this knocked me behind a few years compared to my graduation class and peers   \n",

                                          i had one teacher in college who let you either take your cumulative grade exams homework quizzes or just the final exam grade it wasnt whichever was higher you had to choose before the final exam and live with your choice   i liked it because if you felt like you grew because you took the quizzes exams and homework then received feedback on them you could bet on your self improvement  i had a b going into the final exam i opted for my class grade to purely be reflected by the final exam i set the curve with 99 giving me the highest grade in the class that semester  100   \n",

which ends this month on the 30th   my next paycheck of 16000 kr is due on the 25th   i am living with my mother who wants me to move out once im financially stable   i am considering a fulltime job opportunity in lulea which pays 140kr per hour potentially requiring a car for commuting   the lulea job opportunity is vital as fulltime jobs in my hometown are scarce ive looked extensively and only found opportunities in hemtjnsten home care services which i was fired from due to using the job car privately   my friend want to help me and sell me his old car for 10000kr pretty good car    i am also working towards improving my grades to become a civil engineer but it requires time and money   i have a police record due to an incident where i used the job car for personal tasks like picking up large packages or school work as my family doesnt own a car and its essential in the north of sweden i know this is not an excuse and very stupid thing to do  i regret this every day of my life   please dont make me feel worse about itthis has made finding jobs requiring background checks challenging    the relationship with my mother is strained due to financial issues and other concerns   i am seeking immediate options to move out but financial instability is hindering progress   i want to study because starting university doesnt require a background check the crime i committed will be removed from my record in five years which makes university a good opportunity for me once i settle the debt and improve my grades  challenges and goals  pay off my mothers credit card debt before moving out to improve our relationship and my financial stability   prioritize options to secure fulltime work despite my past challenges   address the need for a car to access the lulea job and potentially other opportunities given the essential role of a car in the north of sweden   overcome strained relationships and work towards personal goals including becoming a civil engineer   secure stable employment without background checks such as hemtjnst    pursue further education and improve my grades to become a civil engineer while managing financial constraints   seek ways to move out with limited financial resources and instability  options considered  option 1 pay off credit card debt first and continue living with my mother   pros  resolving the debt would improve my relationship with my mother   staying with my mother could provide temporary financial stability    cons  will delay moving out    this option may result in unemployment for a while   i wouldnt have the funds to buy the car and job options in my hometown that dont require a background check are limited   mom would still want me to move out  option 2 purchase the car secure fulltime job and pay credit card debt later  pros  acquiring the car would enable me to secure the fulltime job opportunity in lulea   stable employment could lead to improved financial stability over time  cons  prioritizing the car purchase might delay paying off the credit card debt   initial expenses associated with the car purchase along with potential taxes could strain my current financial situation   my mother could become frustrated if i choose to prioritize buying the car before settling the debt this could potentially create a difficult living situation for both of us during that period until i am stable financially to move out and pay my debt    3 pay off the debt be poor live at home and improve my grades and start future studies will take a year at least     what my desirable outcome is to repair my relationship with mom  pay off the debt achieve financial stability secure stable employment while studying and raising my grades and pursue further education for the opportunity to start fresh and build a better future    need some advice on what do to thanks   \n",

software as much as i like coding i wouldnt want to be ft swe   ive got a summer internship lined up at a large tech company in seattle for product management but its not at a dream company of mine i aspire to work at either facebook google linkedin lyft or uber   i switched into cs my junior year my thought for the ms is my passion for learning and id like to intern at one of my dream companies next summer im in the accelerated ms program so it would only be 3 semesters  my current plan do internship this summer go back to school two semesters do an internship at dream company complete last semester of ms while i understand with a ms big tech starts you at a higher pay tier is this plan a poor idea or would i be better off going straight into work and getting pm experience and just moving to my dream company   \n",

for the universities i applied to needed 3739gpa for admission which is really competitive whereas for physics its only a 25 which is more achievable and i was told theres more job opportunities  i only need to do 1 year of physics and math courses 2 calculus courses as well as some other sciences this would be this fall   i havent done math since high school 5 years ago i was in the ap program for math but got a terrible mark 60 and just barely passed never took intro calculus i got this grade because i didnt apply myself or do homework  how can i go from having not done math for years to getting above a 30 gpa   \n",

was build credit cuz youre gonna need to that to rent an apartment get a car ect ect i got a secured credit card which is a credit card where you have to put your own money into it as opposed to a normal credit card where you use money from the card company this is an easy way to establish credit for those with no credit history  what i did with it was basically use it to buy some cheap snacks or something from the gas station or vending machine and then never touch it again for the remainder of the monthid spend around 10 a month using it this way you can get a good credit score after about a year of doing this   \n",

university   since i did not start taking these english classes in grade 9 i couldnt take these classes in high school  i am currently in a program i have no interest in but next year i plan to transfer into a general arts and science program  i contacted admissions at a local university and i can ether take a privet highschool credit to get in or take a couple years in general arts to transfer into university   my plan is take the general arts and science and use that time to work on my health and post secondary skills   im posting this because the public education system failed me my iep was always ignored the guidance department didnt help me im not a dull kid have good grades in collage so far and i have taken online courses in my spare time   i just know there are other guys like me out there so to anyone who feels like there out of place remember 90 of learning is studying the only thing schools do is review studying materials with you and administer tests and labs  you can buy textbooks and not be in university you can even find old textbooks online and some services let you audit classes online so if the education system fails you too dont give up on learning as long as you can try you can succeed   \n",

programming to get a job in a city but no way of saving up to move there if you could get enough money for the relocation and a month of rent or so youd be making your own money soon enough especially if you interview and land a job before relocation thats assuming you have formal education though although i cant assume anything about the german job market im american  if youre not currently equipped to land a job in a city i would suggest going to school again i cant assume much about how higher education works there but here if you get accepted to a university and have low enough income you can get grants and loans that help you to pay for school and living expenses unfortunately living in a village with no access to a job with more payhours ie no way to save money i think means you have to borrow money somehow   \n",

my gedequivalent at age 16 went to community college instead studied computer science changed my major to computer information systems changed it again to computer engineering now 19 and got into the university of my choice at the thirdyear level  tldr did awfully in high school and got to exactly where all my other classmates got to by failing upwards  edits i will admit that youll probably want to pick up those grades in college i get bs and as now im sure you can get where you want to be some other way but good grades in college really help when transferring to a university universities wont care about your high school grades if youre transferring from community college  funny note two years of a language in high school is equivalent to a semester of a language at my college if that puts things in perspective for you  okay last edit also wanted to say that everyones advice on how not to waste their teenage years will very youll never know what your own personal regrets will be until you live through them   \n",

i thought being the class clown was more important than doing my work in retrospect i regret that specifically for the teachers that had to put up with me they were more of babysitters than teachers to me in early high school i decided i wasnt going to go to college schooling wasnt for me with that outlook i didnt care about my grades and the only good grades i got was in my woodworking classes i worked for a few years after high school and decided i needed to continue school and luckily my grades werent so bad that i wasnt able to be accepted into college and im currently studying automotive engineering i love cars ive never had a higher gpa in my life and im taking almost 3x more credits a semester than i did in high school you just have to find what you genuinely enjoy and be good at it its much easier to do what you enjoy and be good at it than do what you dont like in high school it was woodworking still a hobbyist woodworker in collegecareer its cars do what you love youll succeed and have motivation   \n",

                                                 i agree with others here to improve for your self  not for others become the guy you want to be  get fit and strong for yourself  explore your hobbies and interests for yourself  work on your financial future for yourself  as you do this impede your social circle find friend who connect on common interests in school the bandmusic people theatre people academic people sports people have their cliques  my kids did band  academics and sports so had large friend groups  eventually you will find a good mutual connection better with someone and start to date them  i personally worked out and was in the nerd group  i deliberately avoided dating until graduate school so i could focus on school my study partner was my wife  so i technically only dated on person   \n",

asked us all what we like to do and i made up that i play the clarinet when i havent played since i was 11 yes very pathetic the only thing i do in my free time is read books and browse articles on the web other than that i just study and do homework like many others im into a lot of things but not really interested in pursuing any of them in my free time i like music but i dont desire to learn to play an instrument or sing i like looking at art but im not interested in painting or drawing same with sports although i do exercise occasionally to keep healthy i dont have that many friends because i think people think im boring and have nothing to add to the conversation im not sure what is wrong with me i hate having no skills but id rather lay in bed and watch movies and shows than try to better myself   \n",

youve bought into some of these small business memes i see floating around   how to support your friends small business without spending money like a post leave a comment share the post tag a friend

who expect this piss me off hire a professional to promote your business dont try to succeed on free labor donated by your friends my time is just as valuable as yours and i dont use it for work

in my experience meditation helps a lot with all 3 of those things id also suggest you go to your library and pick of meditations of marcus aurelius if your library doesnt have it then you can pick it up online another suggestion i have is a hobby you are interested in that you can do inside or in your backyard maybe buy some of the tools or resources you need for one of the hobbies you may be

classes cost how much time you need to invest or what the ability you need is you could even have a virtual class and virtual lessons that move around your schedule like and thats just art youre already going to the gym so if you join a group gym class then you are spending the same amount of time and group classes can be as little as 6 per class and adapt to our level because you can change the variation or lets say you want to get better at video games maybe you practice with someone and they teach and train you you already are playing video games so you have the time and you can trade you dont have to pay them money are there any skills you have that you could trade like are you good at photography you can take photos for them maybe you buy them lunch maybe you edit x for them or do y service for them people literally train with others for free so they both can improve like this is the style of training that works so if you dont want to do this and track it then thats the problem your method is flawed   \n",

                            actually pay intention in high school and do well so i could have gotten into a good college or do running start college courses while in high school by not doing well in high school i paid the price of wasting time and money on remedial classes at a community college before i started college accredited courses this knocked me behind a few years compared to my graduation class and peers   \n",

                                          i had one teacher in college who let you either take your cumulative grade exams homework quizzes or just the final exam grade it wasnt whichever was higher you had to choose before the final exam and live with your choice   i liked it because if you felt like you grew because you took the quizzes exams and homework then received feedback on them you could bet on your self improvement  i had a b going into the final exam i opted for my class grade to purely be reflected by the final exam i set the curve with 99 giving me the highest grade in the class that semester  100   \n",

youre doing well im currently facing some significant financial challenges and could use some advice and guidance heres a brief overview of my situation  current situation  im an 18yearold who has just graduated from gymnasiet after completing the technical program    i have a debt of 11000 kr on my mothers credit card and i want to repay it   i am currently working parttime 70 in a retail shop which ends this month on the 30th   my next paycheck of 16000 kr is due on the 25th   i am living with my mother who wants me to move out once im financially stable   i am considering a fulltime job opportunity in lulea which pays 140kr per hour potentially requiring a car for commuting   the lulea job opportunity is vital as fulltime jobs in my hometown are scarce ive looked extensively and only found opportunities in hemtjnsten home care services which i was fired from due to using the job car privately   my friend want to help me and sell me his old car for 10000kr pretty good car    i am also working towards improving my grades to become a civil engineer but it requires time and money   i have a police record due to an incident where i used the job car for personal tasks like picking up large packages or school work as my family doesnt own a car and its essential in the north of sweden i know this is not an excuse and very stupid thing to do  i regret this every day of my life   please dont make me feel worse about itthis has made finding jobs requiring background checks challenging    the relationship with my mother is strained due to financial issues and other concerns   i am seeking immediate options to move out but financial instability is hindering progress   i want to study because starting university doesnt require a background check the crime i committed will be removed from my record in five years which makes university a good opportunity for me once i settle the debt and improve my grades  challenges and goals  pay off my mothers credit card debt before moving out to improve our relationship and my financial stability   prioritize options to secure fulltime work despite my past challenges   address the need for a car to access the lulea job and potentially other opportunities given the essential role of a car in the north of sweden   overcome strained relationships and work towards personal goals including becoming a civil engineer   secure stable employment without background checks such as hemtjnst    pursue further education and improve my grades to become a civil engineer while managing financial constraints   seek ways to move out with limited financial resources and instability  options considered  option 1 pay off credit card debt first and continue living with my mother   pros  resolving the debt would improve my relationship with my mother   staying with my mother could provide temporary financial stability    cons  will delay moving out    this option may result in unemployment for a while   i wouldnt have the funds to buy the car and job options in my hometown that dont require a background check are limited   mom would still want me to move out  option 2 purchase the car secure fulltime job and pay credit card debt later  pros  acquiring the car would enable me to secure the fulltime job opportunity in lulea   stable employment could lead to improved financial stability over time  cons  prioritizing the car purchase might delay paying off the credit card debt   initial expenses associated with the car purchase along with potential taxes could strain my current financial situation   my mother could become frustrated if i choose to prioritize buying the car before settling the debt this could potentially create a difficult living situation for both of us during that period until i am stable financially to move out and pay my debt    3 pay off the debt be poor live at home and improve my grades and start future studies will take a year at least     what my desirable outcome is to repair my relationship with mom  pay off the debt achieve financial stability secure stable employment while studying and raising my grades and pursue further education for the opportunity to start fresh and build a better future    need some advice on what do to thanks   \n",

software as much as i like coding i wouldnt want to be ft swe   ive got a summer internship lined up at a large tech company in seattle for product management but its not at a dream company of mine i aspire to work at either facebook google linkedin lyft or uber   i switched into cs my junior year my thought for the ms is my passion for learning and id like to intern at one of my dream companies next summer im in the accelerated ms program so it would only be 3 semesters  my current plan do internship this summer go back to school two semesters do an internship at dream company complete last semester of ms while i understand with a ms big tech starts you at a higher pay tier is this plan a poor idea or would i be better off going straight into work and getting pm experience and just moving to my dream company   \n",

for the universities i applied to needed 3739gpa for admission which is really competitive whereas for physics its only a 25 which is more achievable and i was told theres more job opportunities  i only need to do 1 year of physics and math courses 2 calculus courses as well as some other sciences this would be this fall   i havent done math since high school 5 years ago i was in the ap program for math but got a terrible mark 60 and just barely passed never took intro calculus i got this grade because i didnt apply myself or do homework  how can i go from having not done math for years to getting above a 30 gpa   \n",

was build credit cuz youre gonna need to that to rent an apartment get a car ect ect i got a secured credit card which is a credit card where you have to put your own money into it as opposed to a normal credit card where you use money from the card company this is an easy way to establish credit for those with no credit history  what i did with it was basically use it to buy some cheap snacks or something from the gas station or vending machine and then never touch it again for the remainder of the monthid spend around 10 a month using it this way you can get a good credit score after about a year of doing this   \n",

university   since i did not start taking these english classes in grade 9 i couldnt take these classes in high school  i am currently in a program i have no interest in but next year i plan to transfer into a general arts and science program  i contacted admissions at a local university and i can ether take a privet highschool credit to get in or take a couple years in general arts to transfer into university   my plan is take the general arts and science and use that time to work on my health and post secondary skills   im posting this because the public education system failed me my iep was always ignored the guidance department didnt help me im not a dull kid have good grades in collage so far and i have taken online courses in my spare time   i just know there are other guys like me out there so to anyone who feels like there out of place remember 90 of learning is studying the only thing schools do is review studying materials with you and administer tests and labs  you can buy textbooks and not be in university you can even find old textbooks online and some services let you audit classes online so if the education system fails you too dont give up on learning as long as you can try you can succeed   \n",

programming to get a job in a city but no way of saving up to move there if you could get enough money for the relocation and a month of rent or so youd be making your own money soon enough especially if you interview and land a job before relocation thats assuming you have formal education though although i cant assume anything about the german job market im american  if youre not currently equipped to land a job in a city i would suggest going to school again i cant assume much about how higher education works there but here if you get accepted to a university and have low enough income you can get grants and loans that help you to pay for school and living expenses unfortunately living in a village with no access to a job with more payhours ie no way to save money i think means you have to borrow money somehow   \n",

my gedequivalent at age 16 went to community college instead studied computer science changed my major to computer information systems changed it again to computer engineering now 19 and got into the university of my choice at the thirdyear level  tldr did awfully in high school and got to exactly where all my other classmates got to by failing upwards  edits i will admit that youll probably want to pick up those grades in college i get bs and as now im sure you can get where you want to be some other way but good grades in college really help when transferring to a university universities wont care about your high school grades if youre transferring from community college  funny note two years of a language in high school is equivalent to a semester of a language at my college if that puts things in perspective for you  okay last edit also wanted to say that everyones advice on how not to waste their teenage years will very youll never know what your own personal regrets will be until you live through them   \n",

i thought being the class clown was more important than doing my work in retrospect i regret that specifically for the teachers that had to put up with me they were more of babysitters than teachers to me in early high school i decided i wasnt going to go to college schooling wasnt for me with that outlook i didnt care about my grades and the only good grades i got was in my woodworking classes i worked for a few years after high school and decided i needed to continue school and luckily my grades werent so bad that i wasnt able to be accepted into college and im currently studying automotive engineering i love cars ive never had a higher gpa in my life and im taking almost 3x more credits a semester than i did in high school you just have to find what you genuinely enjoy and be good at it its much easier to do what you enjoy and be good at it than do what you dont like in high school it was woodworking still a hobbyist woodworker in collegecareer its cars do what you love youll succeed and have motivation   \n",
