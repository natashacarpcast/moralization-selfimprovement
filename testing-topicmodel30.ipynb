       "      <td>religion spirituality and the desire for divinity create artificial concepts about our reality in consequence most of us believe that our actions and their effects are nothing else but the consequence of the pure chance or of a superior intelligence this however induces a conflict in us because this concept is in contradiction with our inherent drive which seduces us to become an architect of our destiny namely our deepest desire is to build the road what we walk please stop for a moment and look deep inside yourself to think over this idea our destiny is really in the hands of our gods or we are able to bend the road what we walk according to our desires before answering the question lets assume that everything including all living beings plants animals insects etc is connected to a sole source and that sole source is called collective consciousness at the moment this is the concept that i can identify myself with the foremost it gives me an ultimate satisfaction because it is the climax of all my desires it is the alpha and the omega of my quest for the meaning of life and i can accept it without expecting or looking for any other meaning understanding this concept also requires clarifying the meaning of time in the realm of reality it is different from our usual perception of time that assumes that time is going in a single line from the past towards the future in the reality all time exists all the time that is to say the past the present and the future exist next to each other simultaneously it means that every time already exists including the future that influences our past and present which again counteract with the future how can however everything exist at the moment when we still have not experienced the future because we have already created all our reality in a more developed state of consciousness this state is much beyond our day to day conception and in our human skin we cannot access it easily therefore in day to day term the free will does not exist everything is planned already by ourselves the reason however why we do not see the future is due to the limitations of our day to day consciousness we can not to look into the future because it would seem that we are never free when we can completely overcome the limitations of our body though our consciousness gets immersed in the collective consciousness this is the state of absolute freedom this is the laboratory where we plan our future and where we clearly see the consequences of everything therefore the good the bad the unexpected and the inexplicable all lose their meaning we plan here everything within the collective consciousness taking into consideration everybody we use the collective knowledge and every decision has an impact on the whole system nothing is a sheer chance all of our plans and actions involves all of us in reality however our current capacity does not allow us to see the magnitude of our decisions in a distant or a near future and we do not see how others are involved in our decisions we simply cannot fully grasp the vast scale of the possibilities if you would doubt or ignore the fact that we are intrigued into the consequences of our decisions it is enough to return to the source and immerse your consciousness in the collective consciousness by advanced meditation and strong concentration some of us could have a glimpse of the future and understand the full scale of consequences of a present decision we cling to the idea of free will because we are afraid to lose control fear is however nothing but the lack of light when we accept every possibility and when we stop having expectations then we receive everything naturally this is the only way we to be graced with the power of free will we can decide to pursue the light and be light and this in exchange will result in infinite happiness respect and a state of always growing spiritually only in this state we are allowed to access the collective energy and grow our powerful character the human with free will therefore does not yearn for less than becoming a source of the collective consciousness their willingness alloys them with the universal community and let them access all the collective information and skills</td>\n",

       "191869  sorry for the long text heres my own take on identity coming from a random nobody from anywhere in the world first your vision of identity could be likely too limited if you ask yourself whats my identity you may think i am like this or that or i like this and that or you may think am i one or the other do i desire this or that now ask yourself whats behind your identity is it a born thing is it something determined by the environment or is it something that your own self choose are everyones identity innate this is difficult to believe peoples identity change throughout their lives different people living in different parts of the world may have a similar concept of identify while twins may have a different concept it would be naive to believe genetics have no bearing on your identity but it doesnt determine it what about the environment if your life was different would you be the same person very likely that not you could have been shaped into a very different person if you had grown with drastically different environment and even if you didnt what if you had took a different interpretation for the events that happened what if you decided different things were important if you had given different weights to the events in your life wouldnt you be different too when you think about that you start seeing possibilities you notice that a lot of those things you consider as identity are volatile and could have been totally different what do you see when you try to look inward do you see a fixed well defined one dinensional identity i doubt it what you see is chaos and contradiction all that chaos and contradiction is part of you and thats a great thing their purpose to give birth to your identity because there are so many possibilities they all exist inside you in a certain form and the real you is the one whos born from all those possibilities and again who decides who shapes this chaos into yourself were you born with an identity i believe you were born with the chaos and thats it did the environment shape the chaos into who you are now partly but i believe that really it was our own take on the environment your perception of it that did shape you initially then we come back to your own mind what are you thinking now what are you addressing identity itself why are you doing so because instinctively you know your mind can help you resolve those things as you grow your conscience grows too and your identity starts shifting from the environment to your mind the fact you are having an identity crisis is the proof of that and ultimately it makes sense the whole concept of identity lies within yourself to begin with and the whole of your own self becomes very apparent when you consider your contradictions for everything you think you are or like you probably have a counterexample and how many times your emotions didnt contradict each other and you felt split and divided can you say your actions were never a struggle and you always did everything according to a perfect internal compass humans are living contradictions all those contradictions are part of your chaos and are under the judgement of your mind the role of the mind is to tackle those contradictions and sort through the possibilities lastly lets come back to that initial concept of identity and ask yourself again whats my identity but this time recognize that theres no ultimate answer ecognize that looking for a simple limited answer may not be what you should seek within you theres not a narrow simple identity to be found but chaos and disorder and this chaos of disorder creates possibilities and contradictions so many possible versions of you so many contradictions and conflicts between your me s and atop it all theres your mind but your mind is also you above it all there is you you are within the chaos you are the chaos you are above the chaos you are everything all the possibilities all the contradictions and from all those possibilities you are also the judge of which one should emerge an identity crisis is just a wake up call to all of it to all that freedom to all that chaos and to all those possibilities and once you realize all of it you also realize you are free to be whoever you like you are not bound to any expectative you are not even required to have an identity all of the passing thoughts all the emotions all those things are just part of the chaos and they do not define you they are part of you but that doesnt mean they are you because you are contradiction accept your own contradictions and let go of the parts you dont like and hold on the ones you like take your rightful place of sitting above it all and shaping your own self ive struggled with the issue before and that was my conclusion let me know if you have any questions above all your identity is your ultimate freedom   \n",

       "85475   hello everyone i feel into drama with my group of friends that i know for around years we know each other for around years we ride motorbikes together we went skiing together we went on trips together and things like that so we know each other for long time and have done many things together a few months ago we planned a short trip with my then new gf and couples from the same group of friends so i can introduce my gf to two other couples from the group the problem was that i had to cancel my trip because i feel ill and i couldnt go to the trip and because i canceled the trip my friend from the group friend a and his gf also canceled the trip this decision didnt go well with the friend b and his gf from the group and because of that friend b and his gf turned all other friends from the group against my friend a last weekend we all went the hole group for day trip and everyone ignored friend a and not wanted to talk to him except me friend a talked to friend b about this situation and b didnt want to discus or solve this issue so im noticing now that they started ignoring me to because i talked and hanged around my friend a and i really dont know what to do i couldnt ignore my friend a because he is still my friend and im not into this stupid drama i just want to hang around with my friends and ride motorbikes not acting like some high school teenagers we are all around years old but i also dont want to lose my other friends because its hard for me to find new friends did anything like that happened to you what would you do in my position i hope that my post is logical enough my english is not the best   \n",

       "      <td>okay so you need to find your height and weight google macro calculator and there should be an option at the end for if you want to maintain gain or lose weight the results will tell you how many calories protein carbs and fats you should aim to have in a day its very important that you dont go under no matter what and that you try to get as close as you can to the calories and protein numbers if you go to most websites for restaurants especially fast food they have the nutrition facts for all their food online so you can plan your means ahead of time i recommend subway for the most food for calories any cafeteria style place like subway or chipotle will have a bigger bang for your buck in terms of calories as opposed to a place like mcdonalds because the ingredients need to be fresh at cafeteria style places if you cant afford to eat out or only some days plan what to cook through a similar process get a food scale and learn how to weigh food and make like a weeks worth of meals all one one day so that all the food fits your macros when you are hungry you just eat the premade meals this isnt actually that hard but i would make at least but maybe different types of meals so you dont get board prepare for yourself if you know you like dessert try to plan a dessert into your plan if you like snacks plan for snacks more or less at this stage its calories in calories out meaning calories of skittles and calories of a salad are both calories to your body so you can have calories of skittles if you want now of skittles is significantly less than of salad so you wont be as full and satiated but you can judge for yourself download myfitnesspal to help track your food weigh yourself everyday now depending on how salty the food was how much water you drank etc some days it could look like you gained pounds overnight this is normal you probably just had salty food and your body is retaining water so its water weight as long as your weight is trending down you are on the right track dont fall off the course if or days you gain weight if you are gaining weight for longer adjust your meals and drink water with every meal one you save calories from not having soda or alcohol so you can use those calories on more food but also your stomach is a literal sack and so the more you fill that sack the less hungry you feel so filling with some water will keep you satiated longer</td>\n",

       "199116  im not a fan of restrictive diets i tried if and failed lol i try to do things that i can keep up with for years instead ive been researching this topic and here are some of my tips grocery shop on a full stomach so youre not tempted to buy junk food try not having junk food available at home reduce your sodium intake and drink a lot of water have a glass of warm lemon water in the morning it helps with digestion i hear green tea helps with digestion too increase your fruit and veggie intake fiber helps with digestion and it will help speed up your metabolism which will help you lose fat reduce your dairy intake what type of exercises do you do im not a morning person so i work out in the evening or afternoon in between my classes i do a mix of cardio and strength training cardio helps you burn calories faster but strength training helps you build muscle and ive read that the more muscle you have the harder it will be for you to gain fat you dont have to look like the hulk but a little bit of muscle helps strength training doesnt make me as tired as cardio does chloe ting has some great strength training videos on youtube if youre still hungry eat something healthy instead of staying hungry ive done an experiment on myself before where i noticed that when i was on a calorie restricted diet of foods like dairy and meat and some junk food and when i was on high carb plant based diet with less junk food and more fruits veggies where i would eat a lot more food i ate almost all the time lol i lost weight on the second diet faster even though i was eating less in the first one i didnt change my exercise routine either i didnt count my calories in the second diet though and i know that plant based foods of the same volume as nonplant based foods tend to be lower in calories so that could be one reason but i loved being able to eat large portions and eat whenever i wanted to without worrying about gaining weight as compared to the first diet where i was hungry all the time some other people have done the same and had similar results so you dont have to restrict yourself just choose healthier options you dont have to go completely plant based either try not to skip meals if your body isnt getting enough calories it will go into starvation mode where it will be storing more fat and make it harder to lose fat which also slows down your metabolism i read that getting some sunlight helps you lose fat too   \n",

       "350897                                       okay so you need to find your height and weight google macro calculator and there should be an option at the end for if you want to maintain gain or lose weight the results will tell you how many calories protein carbs and fats you should aim to have in a day its very important that you dont go under no matter what and that you try to get as close as you can to the calories and protein numbers if you go to most websites for restaurants especially fast food they have the nutrition facts for all their food online so you can plan your means ahead of time i recommend subway for the most food for calories any cafeteria style place like subway or chipotle will have a bigger bang for your buck in terms of calories as opposed to a place like mcdonalds because the ingredients need to be fresh at cafeteria style places if you cant afford to eat out or only some days plan what to cook through a similar process get a food scale and learn how to weigh food and make like a weeks worth of meals all one one day so that all the food fits your macros when you are hungry you just eat the premade meals this isnt actually that hard but i would make at least but maybe different types of meals so you dont get board prepare for yourself if you know you like dessert try to plan a dessert into your plan if you like snacks plan for snacks more or less at this stage its calories in calories out meaning calories of skittles and calories of a salad are both calories to your body so you can have calories of skittles if you want now of skittles is significantly less than of salad so you wont be as full and satiated but you can judge for yourself download myfitnesspal to help track your food weigh yourself everyday now depending on how salty the food was how much water you drank etc some days it could look like you gained pounds overnight this is normal you probably just had salty food and your body is retaining water so its water weight as long as your weight is trending down you are on the right track dont fall off the course if or days you gain weight if you are gaining weight for longer adjust your meals and drink water with every meal one you save calories from not having soda or alcohol so you can use those calories on more food but also your stomach is a literal sack and so the more you fill that sack the less hungry you feel so filling with some water will keep you satiated longer   \n",

that i started to changes things in my life to improve like save money my biggest issue and diferent foods more healthy the other issue that i dont think is a issue watching series or play games the question is what to do without that if i dont play games watch tv what i will do instead i thought so many times and if i dont do games tv show my life gets in fact more and more boring more empty but still empty even if i do that things in fact do that things help me to distract about how empty my life is what i can do diferent with pandemic situation i cant go outside so many times in my country we have time do stay home only we can go out is in the morning that i used to go buy food or coffe after that all need stay home of course we can sneaky a bit in the streets anyway so im at home in this moment and the only thing i have is my computer so i used it to distract me so only can be movies shows or games or read reddit youtube twitter in this days new year yestarday and today i only played games and watch tv shows in the end of the day i feel like my day is on repeat and still bored for to the same all the time even after job i still get home do my dinner and go play games tv shows again because is the only thing i have to do of course i can do diferent things if i do my dinner or clean the house but that still be a issue too i already clean the house like all days just to do something and the house is already clean and i clean again and again can be good for fight the virus by the way but still dont know that i miss dont know what i like enjoy to do in my free time i do all the same for years how you guys discover what is your passion even i read an article saying for write in a paper things you like to do wanna do in the future my paper still white the problem here is when i was young i dont explore meet myself in a healthy way my bad family with big problems couse a tremendous stress anxiety we are kids me and my sisters and when my spetfather came home after work something bad could happen almost all days so i learn only to be safe at my room all the time and that destroy what i could be i just wanna be save from that problems so i grow up without show my feeling that destroy my abilitys to comunicate with people or do friends i grow up without experiences good ones in my life even in school i stay out of my collegues and i was a little bullied for be very quiet and i talked very very low volume like i was afraid of everyone even i had problem to get people close to me because i smell bad because my family sometimes dont had hot water so i couldnt take a shower and i was a kid the kids dont know good habbits only if parents teach them my family never got worried about me or my sisters now im an adult with a big emptyness i used drugs to feel better weed all days cocain mda but today im glad in fact that i left that bad habbits because after doing drugs i always felt bad and i learned that i stop be me if i consume it and i have dont know why a strong personality that can break any addiction of course was some days i had a fall but then i came back to learn that i need to stop and i did in fact more easy than i thought could be my motivation for that this i dont wanna destroy my brain dont wanna lose what im after all and dont waste money is stupid things that only do one thing destroy our essence of what we are even i felt alone sad depressed i dont know why but my body my brain always remember me how important is to keep my essence intact for you to know i have a friend not a close friend living in the same house of me and he smoke weed its oki and i discover he do sometimes cocain too and then when i look to him i saw how freakying out he start looking a ugly body he already argued with other friend in the same house we are guys he hit in the hall like crazy he said to me he was on drugs and alcahol bad mixing and i realized in that moment yeah drugs are a big shity indeed and i m pround that i left that life but i know why he do that because he is kinda remember me had family problems too he is alone and that is the core to do drugs the emptyness i realized for me for not do drugs in a easy way to try understand the mind set is i accepted my emptyness my loneless i accepted all of it when you dont accepted you run away all the time using drugs to escape it but now im just thinking that i use tv shows games to distract that emptyness loneless of course i changed my bad habbits for a bad habbits not so bad at all games tv shows is better than do drugs xd but still i know exist something that im missing sometimes my brain my sense try to tell me something that i dont understand what it is someting i need to change in my life to get better but i still keep looking for it i need to understand what my self wanna do in life what is my true passion my true destiny i still need to write that paper in white</td>\n",

says ive been overweight my whole life my dad took me to a nutritionist when i was only or and since then ive been on all kinds of diets and my looks occupy my mind of the time in i have been at my highest weight kg and then i found r loseit community here on reddit and lost since then i weigh about maintaining it and i try to lose more and get more fit because i have no muscle at all the most problematic thing is that i have no life at all i wake up snoozing the alarm and i almost cry that i have to go to work go to work come home lay in bed scroll tiktok instagram reddit and thats whats comfortable for me and its hard for me to leave that comfort zone i am really anxious and a lot of times really negative i want to become better at my job as a developer but deep down i also dont want to i played tennis when i was young took dancing classes sang in choir which i really liked but a lot of my family members dad and sisters made jokes when i did any of that stuff so my confidence now is below zero and i dont want to even try again i feel like im a very boring person with zero interests in life i had social media since facebook and i feel like thats also one of the reasons i lost my interests and attention i used to play wow a lot before i made facebook account i enjoy virtual world and its hard for me to face reality when i dont have phone or laptop with myself i feel im getting a panic attack i tried psychologist but its way too expensive for me now   \n",

                              a lot of your problems sound like a motivation issue try watching podcasts and read books on motivation podcasts can be a good form of education and expanding your knowledge to eat healthier your local grocery store should have meal plans that will tell you what to buy and how to cook it or there are some online options also sticking to a budget will make you stop eating out as often to get better at socializing talk to other co workers often also look up ways to get better and actively think about how you can incorporate it into your life r socialskills helped me do that for the driving it sounds like you have gone through life without it depending on your situation id just stay away from driving for one it costs a lot of money just to get places when you factor in gas and repair ride a bike to replace driving itll also keep you in shape for your hobbies just do something each day like draw a picture every day juggle at least once every day take a photo and watch youtube videos on how to improve honestly youtube is a good way of learning hobbies and critiquing yourself on your days off its ok to do nothing most of the time if you have a day off think of one thing you can do i like to go hang out with a friend for hrs and the rest of the day ill sit around watching podcasts learning about interesring topics i watch every episode of jre or clean one part of your place honestly having a friend or so to help motivate you will dramatically change your life but first you have to get over your social fears try joining a club of some sort like a drawing club or a workout group thatll kill two birds with one stone good luck   \n",

                                                        this is a tried and true answer for myself ive been through traumatic events and have been stuck as you kinda describe waking up and going to bed at a consistent time not doing any late nights cardio and or weightlifting not stopping until theres a ring of sweat around your neck and you feel the runner high you dont have to run it could be elliptical walking treadmill bike etc clean up my fluid intake and diet start putting down the phone social media and start reading a book you would be so surprised how that motivates you in other areas of life it takes discipline but its soooo worth it good luck friend   \n",

                                              would be really great if you could get back into music theres no necessity to have a goal to be a professional artist just to play music you can maybe start performing low key gigs in bars or restaurants or maybe even try tutoring some kids would be also nice if you manage to find a band of people who are also playing for fun and not for a career dance classes art classes cooking classes sewing classes are all great maybe you can find a class that is more consistent even though you dont connect with people this way i think traveling around alone is nice just around the city you live in trying out cheap restaurants and stuff taking pictures along the way would make you feel like you have explored a bit cooking food that isnt basic and learning to plate them nicely is great too also practicing making some fancy cocktails is nice you cant necessarily connect with lots of people this way but you can always invite people over for dinner and drinks community service is absolutely wonderful if you can join a good team going out and helping the homeless drug addicts poor families and all leaves you feeling like you did something for the world as well actually playing music at orphanages or hospitals for children or the elderly sounds really sweet dont you think this might seem like a lot of work though these are all more likely things that you would do inconsistently but still great ways to spend your free time   \n",

felt slow and cringy as hell am now and the last years got a partner in crime kiddos went through therapy got a car a nice place to stay in fairly decent but still modest income am paying off all the debt i made in my younger days but at the end of the day the sky is the limit the first between i was doing drugs dropped out of college partying on drugs to overcome my social anxiety but everything played part in me becoming a social butterfly i can genuinly say that most people who are socially awkward in their early will probably exceed the people they think are very social in social skill being honest about being socially awkward is the first step in overcoming   \n",

little about myself im a year old guy just graduated hs last year and chose to take a year off school so ive been working the same retail job since july make pretty good money and have my own car but ive had the same problems ive had for the past seven years i feel depressed i have bad social anxiety havent dated anyone in years slept through most of high school and have dropped contact with all of my friends i have zero motivation these days and all i do now is watch the days go by i work about hours a week and i am so tired when i get a day off that i usually just spend it inside playing video games it sucks and i hate it but i dont know how to change it a lot of my friends are off on their own now ive seen so many of my friends get into long lasting relationships that phase me out of their lives and we stop talking but i have no one and im not sure why i would love to make a change but i dont know where to start i dont necessarily struggle with my appearance im somewhere around and am thin as a rail i probably only weigh around i have some pound weights and i took a weight lifting class in high school but the motivation to work out is too much does anyone have any advice for someone in my situation i could really use it and it would be really appreciated   \n",

far i dont have a drivers license never had a job embarrassing and never had a relationship before embarrassing i feel so irresponsible in so many ways while all of my friends have done all of that shit at least years ago i have social anxiety and spend a lot of time alone or with family i have some hobbies such as hiking reading and i regularly go to the gym but usually i just fall into the trap of social media and youtube for most of my days i feel so insecure about my accomplishments or lack thereof on the positive note i have a good gpa in college but i feel as if everyone is more mature and accomplished than me in many ways and it really gets me down this summer for example i usually just stayed at home by myself watching netflix youtube and reading and would go out to lunch with my parents what should i do about this how can i feel better about myself   \n",

this time is making me realize how much of a loser i am i realize that i only have friends because of school i dont like school but im thankful to it for allowing me to forcefully socialize now that im not able to go to school because of coronavirus im losing my friends because im not contacting them as i should busy with school on top of all of that im drowning myself with credit hours because i want to take backup classes at my home university just in case im not able to continue my study abroad this may june im so busy that i dont have time to look for a job and im realizing how hard it is to sustain my money without any income but i live with my family so i dont think earning income is my main priority no motivation whatsoever basically ive done nothing these past few months but do homework and watch youtube videos all day long i havent been outside since my last semester ended december and being stuck in a small house with my family doesnt help with my motivation at all i cant talk to my friends family because im too depressed and im losing a lot of my emotions feelings toward other people trying to create a productive plan i saw one video that suggested that i should work on improving one of these four areas during quarantine health wealth relationships happiness i think i may have to focus on improving my relationships first but when i keep trying to make a plan to be more productive the next day i keep resorting to youtube videos i think that binge watching youtube videos is my way to relieve stress but theres no end to it what small steps can i take to improve my relationships i dont want to overwhelm myself and resort back to youtube again   \n",

the best grades you can so you could go to a college after school and leave your parents house they could not stop you after you are and with good grades you might get a scholarship will they let you go to gym science or music clubs you could find like minded people there and would not feel so alone are they super religious some churches have teenager clubs some of them are fun like an ukulele club at my town church ukulele itself will not help with self improvement but it is about about friends social interactions self esteem and better mental health you could also talk about your needs with a priest and hopefully he will help you and talk to your parents for free online classes on psychology self improvement etc look at coursera and edx sites the site for videos this sub doesnt let me mention yo___be has a lot of videos about self improvement personal development and fitness workouts just search it books would they let you go to a library does your local library allow free access to ebooks like hoopla site so you dont even have to leave your house for free online live support groups for teens mental health meditation yoga look at meetup and eventbrite sites for mental health depends on your country you could go to a school counselor and the will work with you for free or refer you to someone and i think again depends on your country laws in this case they cannot refuse to take you there because the are obligated to care for your health till you are   \n",

that i started to changes things in my life to improve like save money my biggest issue and diferent foods more healthy the other issue that i dont think is a issue watching series or play games the question is what to do without that if i dont play games watch tv what i will do instead i thought so many times and if i dont do games tv show my life gets in fact more and more boring more empty but still empty even if i do that things in fact do that things help me to distract about how empty my life is what i can do diferent with pandemic situation i cant go outside so many times in my country we have time do stay home only we can go out is in the morning that i used to go buy food or coffe after that all need stay home of course we can sneaky a bit in the streets anyway so im at home in this moment and the only thing i have is my computer so i used it to distract me so only can be movies shows or games or read reddit youtube twitter in this days new year yestarday and today i only played games and watch tv shows in the end of the day i feel like my day is on repeat and still bored for to the same all the time even after job i still get home do my dinner and go play games tv shows again because is the only thing i have to do of course i can do diferent things if i do my dinner or clean the house but that still be a issue too i already clean the house like all days just to do something and the house is already clean and i clean again and again can be good for fight the virus by the way but still dont know that i miss dont know what i like enjoy to do in my free time i do all the same for years how you guys discover what is your passion even i read an article saying for write in a paper things you like to do wanna do in the future my paper still white the problem here is when i was young i dont explore meet myself in a healthy way my bad family with big problems couse a tremendous stress anxiety we are kids me and my sisters and when my spetfather came home after work something bad could happen almost all days so i learn only to be safe at my room all the time and that destroy what i could be i just wanna be save from that problems so i grow up without show my feeling that destroy my abilitys to comunicate with people or do friends i grow up without experiences good ones in my life even in school i stay out of my collegues and i was a little bullied for be very quiet and i talked very very low volume like i was afraid of everyone even i had problem to get people close to me because i smell bad because my family sometimes dont had hot water so i couldnt take a shower and i was a kid the kids dont know good habbits only if parents teach them my family never got worried about me or my sisters now im an adult with a big emptyness i used drugs to feel better weed all days cocain mda but today im glad in fact that i left that bad habbits because after doing drugs i always felt bad and i learned that i stop be me if i consume it and i have dont know why a strong personality that can break any addiction of course was some days i had a fall but then i came back to learn that i need to stop and i did in fact more easy than i thought could be my motivation for that this i dont wanna destroy my brain dont wanna lose what im after all and dont waste money is stupid things that only do one thing destroy our essence of what we are even i felt alone sad depressed i dont know why but my body my brain always remember me how important is to keep my essence intact for you to know i have a friend not a close friend living in the same house of me and he smoke weed its oki and i discover he do sometimes cocain too and then when i look to him i saw how freakying out he start looking a ugly body he already argued with other friend in the same house we are guys he hit in the hall like crazy he said to me he was on drugs and alcahol bad mixing and i realized in that moment yeah drugs are a big shity indeed and i m pround that i left that life but i know why he do that because he is kinda remember me had family problems too he is alone and that is the core to do drugs the emptyness i realized for me for not do drugs in a easy way to try understand the mind set is i accepted my emptyness my loneless i accepted all of it when you dont accepted you run away all the time using drugs to escape it but now im just thinking that i use tv shows games to distract that emptyness loneless of course i changed my bad habbits for a bad habbits not so bad at all games tv shows is better than do drugs xd but still i know exist something that im missing sometimes my brain my sense try to tell me something that i dont understand what it is someting i need to change in my life to get better but i still keep looking for it i need to understand what my self wanna do in life what is my true passion my true destiny i still need to write that paper in white   \n",

                     i had been going to a studio for two years so i had a good idea of the style i liked and different postures but then my budget changed drastically and i couldnt afford a membership at home i watch youtube videos i really like yoga with adriene she mostly focuses on vinyasa style which is what works for me but there are so many channels and its great that its free so you can figure out what you like i am not knowledgeable enough yet to lead my own practice at home so videos make it really fun and allow me to switch it up also look around your town for community classes a lot of places have a day of the week where you can go to yoga for free   \n",

       "      <td>hello i want you to relax and read this i prefer woman like you ofcourse every man wants a beautiful woman at his side i do to ive had about serious relationships one of them was average looking and i liked being with her the most even though my last girlfriend had the coolest personality i dont know if its actually an insecurity but i really dislike being with a super attractive woman shes so used to attention and being gnawed and looked at that it becomes a way of life so when she walks around unknowingly she would look around to see if anyone is looking at her flipping her hair and shit yknow so this does give woman an ego that im beautiful and all men desire me now not all woman are like this at all but out of hot girls ive dated and hooked up with was like this where the average looking girls not hot nor ugly at all just average were so more humble much more friendly much more loving and caring because hot woman dont have to provide anything to get attention point is you sound like a decent person and if i werent probably away from you dunno where youre from but i can promise you its not close id taken you out for a drink or to go do something fun there are men out there that really dont give a shit how you look but care about how you are inside and there will be men that think you are beautiful i personaly am more attracted to pale girls than tanned girls so theres already one point that someone may be interrested in you you get what im saying right when your soul is beautiful no makeup breasts hair eye color ass legs abs or face can be more beautiful</td>\n",

       "      <td>when a trait is characteristic of something it sets that thing apart for example a characteristic trait of giraffe is its long neck but not that it has legs a characteristic trait of men and boys is what sets them apart from non males in other words females now these characteristic traits dont have to be positive or biological maybe they are characteristic in a certain culture or subculture you mentioned being kind as a masculine trait i dont see any reason to believe men are any kinder than women on average this isnt a characteristic trait of men and therefore isnt masculine not only does masculinity involve characteristic traits but also expected traits so any trait that is expected of men more than women is a masculine trait as well so in my opinion violence is a masculine trait its a negative one so maybe we wouldnt list it since this subreddit is about self improvement but it is seen a lot more in males</td>\n",
