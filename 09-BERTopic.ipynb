       "453723  hitler wasnt born evil hitler was born with ultimate potential for either good or evil just like of the rest of us he made a series of choices which ultimately led evil choices and to horrific consequences his actions were evil perhaps he himself came to embody evil but he as a human cant inherently be evil every single human born into this world has the potential to become a hitler or to become a buddha we all have infinite potential in either direction the most dangerous thing you can convince yourself of is i am not capable of doing evil things we are all capable step by step micro decision by micro decision if you believe you simply dont have the potential or capacity to do evil things you are statistically more likely to end up doing evil things bc you can gradually and progressively justify your choices until you find yourself doing evil things if you think you arent capable of darkness you are more susceptible darkness will sneak up on you better defense only real defense against your darker nature is to come to know and understand your shadow self get uncomfortably familiar with what your shadow might be capable of given context and rationalization only this way can you identify pathways which will lead you to bad places and avoid even the appearance of evil by knowing that you hold ultimate potential within yourself and you consciously choose to do right action knowing you could if you wanted to choose anything else   \n",
