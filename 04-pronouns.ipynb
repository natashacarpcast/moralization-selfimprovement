       "435059  yes of course you feel exhausted it is exhausting when our mind turns against us in these ways it sounds like youre just getting stuck in perfectionistic all or nothing thinking which may be stemming from low self esteem you start off well with trying to identify the things that are causing you to feel down and actively trying to do things to improve your mental state and life you also are very aware of the flaws in your thinking or when your thinking is becoming unproductive and are actively seeking ways to solve this this is something you should be proud of because it is something you are doing right with the rest youve set yourself up to fail with making things too all or nothing this is unrealistic real life causes unpredictable things to happen that require us to be more flexible during the day with our schedule in planning things out you need to allow time and space for something unexpected to happen during your day so that when those things do happen like you wind up waking up late youre prepared for how to accept it and manage it and you dont allow one thing to suck the joy out of your entire day you also need to improve your self talk basically this amounts to training yourself to talk to yourself the way you would a child that you love it is essentially learning to parent yourself this is especially good practice for you because youre about to become a father if it helps try to imagine what you would say to your child if they were in the same situation as you how would you encourage them most of us would never dare speak to others the way we talk to ourselves so dont put up with hateful thoughts towards yourself part of parenting yourself and cultivating more positive self talk is learning how to validate your own feelings so for example in the instance where you fall into catastrophic thinking with worrying that your friend will be mad at you you can acknowledge that the thinking itself is irrational while also acknowledging the very valid emotions beneath the thought you can say something like im feeling anxious and scared right now you can go on to explore where this feeling is stemming from could be from non related past traumas or something else but here it is about sitting in a place of non judgment with your thoughts and your feelings when we judge ourselves for having a thought or a feeling it becomes much more magnified and harder to accept and release you will be much less exhausted if you train yourself to remove your judgments towards your thoughts and your feelings they are just thoughts they are just feelings you dont have to attach to them you can observe them with a child like curiosity   \n",

       "      <td>this is a big realisation well done for coming to it for realising the pattern wasnt serving you and for seeking help to me this comes from the disconnect between your outer representation and your inner self people expect one thing and get another whether consciously or unconsciously they feel tricked and so they distance themselves from you ultimately the work is to merge the two this isnt a quick job perhaps its a lifetimes work but its moving in the right direction which feels good you dont need to completely solve it before you start to feel better about things we learn to hide the parts of us that have been hurt before thats not a bad way to get through a temporary crappy situation its not a great way to live a whole life though quite often it ends up in a strange feedback loop where we try and protect ourselves that doesnt quite work and we feel the need to protect ourselves more using the same old strategy perhaps it is the fear of being rejected or abandoned that prevents you on some level from creating an external personal which matches your inner one if you want to explore letting this go you can either seek a professional coach therapist to support you or try it on your own you need to go slower on your own but thats not always a bad thing i would add that this is less about turning yourself into something different that it is about letting your authentic self into the world that authentic self is exactly what the world and the people around you most need if you do want to explore then try experimenting in a safe way with your external identity be playful try changing small things when you are with people you trust you want to find the balance between something that feels exciting and a little scary you cant be playful if the results would be catastrophic aim for something that feels around of the maximum risk youre willing to take remember the fearful parts of you are just that parts of you they are not all of you if they panic and get overwhelmed they may feel like it but they are not if the fear starts to get overwhelming step back the effort a notch its ok to go slow</td>\n",

       "      <td>metaphor analogy time do you remember learning to tie your shoes how impossible it seemed when it was easy for your parents and those around you how do you think you would describe your first hand full of attempts at this if your not being nice probably pretty bad terrible even to radically change analogies think of bruce lee the reason he got to the level he did was because he sat there and put in tens of thousands of reps and before that he had to put in thousands of reps just to get the correct form the problem is perspective maybe expectations youre evaluating things and comparing them to others right now when your a kid its normal expected and part of the process to suck at tying your shoes its part of the process to suck at keeping form during kata repetitions basically but when you show up to the gym and compare your form on day one to someone elses form without knowing if they had been practicing for a year or their entire life youre not going to like what you see but you are also skewing the perspective wildly to set yourself up for that compare yourself to who you were yesterday not who someone else is today for a practical sense practice it like a skill both whatever you want to learn but also the skill of getting yourself to do it you could set goals time blocks to work on something for minutes regardless of what you think of it then do it again the next day and repeat for a week or two then compare it to your day attempt to your later attempts this should allow you to see for yourself the effects of reps effort rather than just me explaining motivational sounding things at you and hoping they sink in if you have trouble with or dont like that then maybe try doing something once and if you dislike it do it again but instead of aiming for perfect just aim to do it better compete against yourself i also struggle with this and some days are better than others and its always easier said then done but trying to keep a decent perspective on it can make it easier and help get you moving hope this helps</td>\n",

       "213244  this is a big realisation well done for coming to it for realising the pattern wasnt serving you and for seeking help to me this comes from the disconnect between your outer representation and your inner self people expect one thing and get another whether consciously or unconsciously they feel tricked and so they distance themselves from you ultimately the work is to merge the two this isnt a quick job perhaps its a lifetimes work but its moving in the right direction which feels good you dont need to completely solve it before you start to feel better about things we learn to hide the parts of us that have been hurt before thats not a bad way to get through a temporary crappy situation its not a great way to live a whole life though quite often it ends up in a strange feedback loop where we try and protect ourselves that doesnt quite work and we feel the need to protect ourselves more using the same old strategy perhaps it is the fear of being rejected or abandoned that prevents you on some level from creating an external personal which matches your inner one if you want to explore letting this go you can either seek a professional coach therapist to support you or try it on your own you need to go slower on your own but thats not always a bad thing i would add that this is less about turning yourself into something different that it is about letting your authentic self into the world that authentic self is exactly what the world and the people around you most need if you do want to explore then try experimenting in a safe way with your external identity be playful try changing small things when you are with people you trust you want to find the balance between something that feels exciting and a little scary you cant be playful if the results would be catastrophic aim for something that feels around of the maximum risk youre willing to take remember the fearful parts of you are just that parts of you they are not all of you if they panic and get overwhelmed they may feel like it but they are not if the fear starts to get overwhelming step back the effort a notch its ok to go slow   \n",

       "78678   the solitary most important thing you need to do on your self improvement journey is learn correctly learning is comprised of two aspects acknowledging reading watching listening retaining remembering what you learned when you need to apply it applying doing what you need to do when the time comes this post will help you optimize all three how to acknowledge correctly the process of acknowledging requires two things attention focusing sensory organs reception comprehension of the focus its easy to optimize attention focus on what youre reading listening to or watching do one thing at a time to optimize reception try to summarize what you learned as you go along if its a complex topic try to summarize each paragraph every minute clip or soundbite look up every single word you dont understand until the concepts make sense once you have effectively learned how to acknowledge new information the next most important thing is depositing it into long term memory how to retain retention is extremely simple but few people understand how to actually do it correctly what im about to teach you i learned while interning under a counselor whos job it was to help teach first generation college students the correct way to memorize information repetition does not help reviewing does repetition is like walking it will get you there but slowly reviewing is like taking a car its much faster at encoding long term memory how to review to review something write a prompt on a piece of paper now i want you to think of the answer without examining a reference that process of recalling carves a mental grove in your brain linking a trigger the prompt to a response the information if you instead used a notecard and immediately examined the answer your brain didnt have to do anything so minimal learning occurs if you repeat instead of review the second you stop repeating the information begins to fade after learning how to review i can recall some texts verbatim i havent read in years how to apply once youve learned how to receive information retain the information the only thing standing in your way is application when it comes down to applying its mostly our reluctance to act that stands in our way to overcome this focus on habit formation pick the habit you just learned about pick the absolute smallest step do it for days then up the intensity when i started at the gym i literally just lifted the bar because thats all i could do i now lift with x weights years later thats it optimize your intake optimize your retention optimize your application then you will grow   \n",

       "234294            its enticing to retreat into your shell but i also found that its a great time to start on things youve been wanting to change do explore the main challenge is to start the habit after spending a lot of time in the bedroom i started trying something different for a change downloaded a habit forming tracker app set simple goals e g steps a day the outdoors help meditate read this led to me then deciding i wanted to build up muscle and lose some weight downloaded a nutrition tracker and its going well it feels like a game completing small goals each day and definitely helped my mood i think moving more helps so much i started finding ways to learn new things online too   \n",

       "377332   look young man i understand your frustration but there is a light at the end of the tunnel i hope after reading that you will see it cause i dont like to motivate without getting into details i have assisted your situation from what you have shared and i find that there are two main aspects you need to improve in order to make realistic improvements your mental state self talk your emotional control your ability to say no when you want to do any destructive behavior those two elements are the only things you should start reading about and applying in your life i hope i gave you enough signs to start your own personal journey if you still have questions feel free to write them   \n",
