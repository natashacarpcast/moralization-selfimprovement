       "      <td>people are kinda basic animals as a man you need to look like you can back up your words with violence   work out to look strong and look like you can handle yourself and others will be more inclined to follow you rather than bully you  it can sound like an arduous process but its not that long considering the time will pass anyway  some secret tips if you need to feel like you have an edge weight train your neck and traps a fair amount you can also expand your airways with breathing exercises and do cardio to increase your lung capacity shoulder mobility exercises also help men look more capable and intimidating chew gum at least once every other day until just before you jaw muscles are sore    stretch every day and maintain proper posture move like a champion athlete who has never been injured and cant imagine what it feels like to come in second place  be a borderline overconfident parody of an alpha male peoples standards are pretty unreasonable have you seen that gif of kobe bryant having a basketball suddenly shoved an inch away from his face and he doesnt even blink work on cultivating that energy i grew up in a rougher area where flinching at such things was considered a sign of weakness which to me seemed ridiculous but its about being able to handle things other people cant handle situational awareness to not be caught off guard and to never be afraid of anything especially that which cant hurt you  some basic things you can do can be stuff like watch horror movies without looking away without jumping at the sudden jumpscares yes literally try t act tough like one of those macho weirdos it works play elden ring without flinching when some big attack comes at you     every shower turn it cold for 30 seconds just stand there toughing it out get used to the discomfort if you pay attention you start to notice it doesnt even hurt youre not really damaging your body in  any way so you can bear it stand there like youre the toughest badass in the universe and you cant believe somebody thought this pathetic cold shower would stop you  you know the advice for giving speeches like remove all uhhhhs and ummms do that but on a greater level remove all uncertainty from your speech and actions as practice do this even when alone when you know what to do do it without hesitation focus on executing it flawlessly even the most basic actions like getting up to get a glass of water  learn to anticipate when a situation is going to cause problems for you and suggest an alternative you can stand up for yourself without needing to be confrontational make it like you cant imagine someone would think you were a doormat so they simply must not have thought of the other things yet  since eye contact is a big deal for you overcoming this hurdle will help you feel bolder remember that eyes are just organs looking someone in the eye feels intense but it is really no different than looking at someones mouth when theyre talking just try to do it more each week youre at 30 per cent now bring it up to 35 per cent this week 40 per cent next week etc until youre at a level you think the best most unstoppable version of yourself would use  also focus on your hygiene and fashion be really clean cut pay extra attention to detail do things like trim frayed threads on your clothes pluck that stray eyebrow hair always look like you consciously put effort into making yourself presentable this is inviting to others think of people who do they opposite they go out in their pyjamas with frazzled hair nothing against those people but you just know theyre not out here to make conversation theyre there to get something and leave asap be the opposite of that dress so that if something important suddenly happens youre ready ceo visiting your office meeting the girl of your dreams youre dressed appropriately and this confidence can carry you through less intense situations as well knowing that you spent the time to prepare  talk more just to gain social experience socializing is hard and if you are the antisocial type even with a flawless character and great maturity you can fall behind your peers in social skills when they are doing it ten times as much as you so put in effort catching up on that and make conversation more and make people feel like they are never making a mistake in talking to you  dont be afraid to offend or annoy people once in a while if that is what must happen for you to live the life you want nobodys perfect you wont lose all trust and respect from someone if you make a couple missteps people do forget and move on especially if you are so often proving your heart is in the right place   also to be able to act like you dont need other peoples approval and arent dependent on it you must make sure that is literally true make it so you dont need a job and you can stand up for yourself more and negotiate for more make it so you can leave a social situation any time you want and you can leave the second you feel a boundary has been crossed make it so youre not dependent on a relationship and you can set the terms just like the other person can</td>\n",

                                                 selfconfidence by definition comes from trust in your own judgement it is apparent that you lack this trust so you should focus on developing it you do this by becoming more deliberate about the choices and decisions that you make but you must venture out and dare to stand alone and ask yourself what you think and believe in yourself and not just follow the whim or what someone else says you have to start thinking and finding  your own reasons for what you want to do and choose to do this requires that you are prepared to take on this responsibility and the responsibility for your own mistakes when you make them it is evident that this does not come naturally to you so it will take time and effort to develop this habit but it can be done and it does not require that you are superintelligent one thing that can help in developing this habit is to start journaling or start logging what you do and why so you start noticing and becoming more aware of what you do and why awareness is the first step i have found that one especially good way to do this is to start keeping a daily or even hourly retrospective log of what you are doing so each hour or day you write down what you have done since the last log and perhaps even why you did it if it is not obvious this will create the habit in you to start asking these types of questions of yourself now with time you will get super confident this way because you will be more aware and know exactly what you are doing and why as you are doing it and others will naturally start following you you naturally become a leader figure when you know your reasons and whys and can show the way you get a solid frame of mind by knowing what you are doing and why and you can back it up when questioned this is the root of selfconfidence selfconfidence does not require that you are very smart notice that a lot of leaders are not that smart but they are almost all confident in themselves for good or for bad if you are not that knowledgeable you can still be confident about the things that you know and also you can be confident about your stance that there are many  knowledge domains that do not interest you a bit you will be recognised outwardly as confident when you can stand for this you can actually be confident about the fact that you lack some knowledge openly and come about it from the side of strength so selfconfidence is about your trust in your judgement so do everything to build up a trust in yourself   \n",

in perfectionisticall or nothing thinking which may be stemming from low selfesteem you start off well with trying to identify the things that are causing you to feel down and actively trying to do things to improve your mental state and life you also are very aware of the flaws in your thinking or when your thinking is becoming unproductive and are actively seeking ways to solve this this is something you should be proud of because it is something you are doing right  with the rest youve set yourself up to fail with making things too all or nothing this is unrealistic real life causes unpredictable things to happen that require us to be more flexible during the day with our schedule in planning things out you need to allow time and space for something unexpected to happen during your day so that when those things do happen like you wind up waking up late youre prepared for how to accept it and manage it and you dont allow one thing to suck the joy out of your entire day  you also need to improve your selftalk basically this amounts to training yourself to talk to yourself the way you would a child that you love it is essentially learning to parent yourself this is especially good practice for you because youre about to become a father if it helps try to imagine what you would say to your child if they were in the same situation as you how would you encourage them most of us would never dare speak to others the way we talk to ourselves so dont put up with hateful thoughts towards yourself  part of parenting yourself and cultivating more positive selftalk is learning how to validate your own feelings so for example in the instance where you fall into catastrophic thinking with worrying that your friend will be mad at you you can acknowledge that the thinking itself is irrational while also acknowledging the very valid emotions beneath the thought you can say something like im feeling anxious and scared right now you can go on to explore where this feeling is stemming from  could be from nonrelated past traumas or something else but here it is about sitting in a place of nonjudgment with your thoughts and your feelings when we judge ourselves for having a thought or a feeling it becomes much more magnified and harder to accept and release you will be much less exhausted if you train yourself to remove your judgments towards your thoughts and your feelings they are just thoughts they are just feelings you dont have to attach to them you can observe them with a childlike curiosity   \n",

one is cool  everyone has a shit show inside them waiting to jump out  you took a big step by reaching out for that you should give yourself some praise  so many people live their lives in quiet desperation and never change  you took a hard first step  they may look or sound cool but thats just them playing their fiddle pandering to their crowd  people are on the whole complex and messy  you should never feel like its a one sided thing  you cannot have a conversation by yourself  sometimes its just about finding the right response to the message youre putting out there in the world   secondly if you feel like youre boring or have nothing to say pick up a new hobby  hobbies are great for meeting new people finding new topics of conversation and expressing yourself in different ways  exercise is a great option  makes you feel good about you and trains your mind and body to get comfortable with conflict struggle and perseverance  running is a great way to do that for the low cost of a comfortable pair of shoes  you dont have to be fast you just have to try  hurts like hell at first but just try 5 min to start walk some then build from there    books and ted talks are also a great way to enrich your mind expand your horizons and fuel future topics of conversation  believe me everyone has felt very similar feelings you are now  maybe not to the same degree maybe worse but you are 100 not alone    with respect to the job try looking around for a local gig  any job can be a good thing  preferably something working with other people to give you an opportunity to practice but thats easier said than done  if you dont have the necessary skills try looking up free courses to learn  even simple things like microsoft office or data entry is an easy way to get started  think small easy steps  do one then another then another then boom youre further than you were yesterday  celebrate the little wins along the way  lastly as jim rohn intuitively said we are the average of the top five people we spend the most time with  if someone is negative in your life take steps to minimize their influence on you  wishing you the best of luck and support on your journey keep your chin up and remember there are good people in the world who will appreciate you for who you are but you have to appreciate yourself first  sometimes people just need you to show them what they may not take the time to find themselves  practice is key and failure inevitable  what makes a difference is the willingness to try despite   \n",
       "451511  people are kinda basic animals as a man you need to look like you can back up your words with violence   work out to look strong and look like you can handle yourself and others will be more inclined to follow you rather than bully you  it can sound like an arduous process but its not that long considering the time will pass anyway  some secret tips if you need to feel like you have an edge weight train your neck and traps a fair amount you can also expand your airways with breathing exercises and do cardio to increase your lung capacity shoulder mobility exercises also help men look more capable and intimidating chew gum at least once every other day until just before you jaw muscles are sore    stretch every day and maintain proper posture move like a champion athlete who has never been injured and cant imagine what it feels like to come in second place  be a borderline overconfident parody of an alpha male peoples standards are pretty unreasonable have you seen that gif of kobe bryant having a basketball suddenly shoved an inch away from his face and he doesnt even blink work on cultivating that energy i grew up in a rougher area where flinching at such things was considered a sign of weakness which to me seemed ridiculous but its about being able to handle things other people cant handle situational awareness to not be caught off guard and to never be afraid of anything especially that which cant hurt you  some basic things you can do can be stuff like watch horror movies without looking away without jumping at the sudden jumpscares yes literally try t act tough like one of those macho weirdos it works play elden ring without flinching when some big attack comes at you     every shower turn it cold for 30 seconds just stand there toughing it out get used to the discomfort if you pay attention you start to notice it doesnt even hurt youre not really damaging your body in  any way so you can bear it stand there like youre the toughest badass in the universe and you cant believe somebody thought this pathetic cold shower would stop you  you know the advice for giving speeches like remove all uhhhhs and ummms do that but on a greater level remove all uncertainty from your speech and actions as practice do this even when alone when you know what to do do it without hesitation focus on executing it flawlessly even the most basic actions like getting up to get a glass of water  learn to anticipate when a situation is going to cause problems for you and suggest an alternative you can stand up for yourself without needing to be confrontational make it like you cant imagine someone would think you were a doormat so they simply must not have thought of the other things yet  since eye contact is a big deal for you overcoming this hurdle will help you feel bolder remember that eyes are just organs looking someone in the eye feels intense but it is really no different than looking at someones mouth when theyre talking just try to do it more each week youre at 30 per cent now bring it up to 35 per cent this week 40 per cent next week etc until youre at a level you think the best most unstoppable version of yourself would use  also focus on your hygiene and fashion be really clean cut pay extra attention to detail do things like trim frayed threads on your clothes pluck that stray eyebrow hair always look like you consciously put effort into making yourself presentable this is inviting to others think of people who do they opposite they go out in their pyjamas with frazzled hair nothing against those people but you just know theyre not out here to make conversation theyre there to get something and leave asap be the opposite of that dress so that if something important suddenly happens youre ready ceo visiting your office meeting the girl of your dreams youre dressed appropriately and this confidence can carry you through less intense situations as well knowing that you spent the time to prepare  talk more just to gain social experience socializing is hard and if you are the antisocial type even with a flawless character and great maturity you can fall behind your peers in social skills when they are doing it ten times as much as you so put in effort catching up on that and make conversation more and make people feel like they are never making a mistake in talking to you  dont be afraid to offend or annoy people once in a while if that is what must happen for you to live the life you want nobodys perfect you wont lose all trust and respect from someone if you make a couple missteps people do forget and move on especially if you are so often proving your heart is in the right place   also to be able to act like you dont need other peoples approval and arent dependent on it you must make sure that is literally true make it so you dont need a job and you can stand up for yourself more and negotiate for more make it so you can leave a social situation any time you want and you can leave the second you feel a boundary has been crossed make it so youre not dependent on a relationship and you can set the terms just like the other person can   \n",

that much information about what it took for them to achieve success  but we have full information on the messy reality of our own lives what we have or have not done we see all our flaws all our base motivations all the mistakes we have made  we have a much more complete picture of ourselves and its that detail that discourages us the messy reality of our actual process can never hold a candle to our perfect ideal set of steps we imagine our role model took to achieve success   this comparison robs us of the ability to persevere because all our flaws are real all our mistakes did happen and if we compare those flaws and mistakes to this idealized version of another persons success we are always going to be found wanting it seems impossible that we can achieve the same success  so what to do how do we get around this  the difference between success and failure doesnt come down to doing every step successfully it comes down to persevering when you do a step unsuccessfully  we can use the end point of other people as a goal as an aiming point we can imagine the successful steps they took in order to guide ourselves but we cant use that as a comparison for how well we are doing only for what we should be doing focus not on the quality of their execution but on the nature of what the steps are  in order to do this in order to connect their successful reality to our own actual reality we still try and work out the successful steps executed by our successful role model but we must also imagine them going through exactly the trials and tribulations the mistakes and bad decisions that we are dealing with   and we imagine them pushing through to success just like we are going to  it almost doesnt matter if they actually did encounter those same trials we are not judging them we are simply using them as a model to emulate and as such we are just fleshing out that model with the good and the bad so that it becomes more realistic and more relevant to our own lives  we go from thinking that only what we do correctly matters to a more holistic view that aiming for success and persevering through failure are both equally important  only once we view success as something that comes from a real messy contradictory actual human life can we implement it in our own real messy contradictory actual human life   \n",
