       "233185  i like the use of the phrase not being an asshole but that leaves a wide gap in terms of subjectivity and so does the phrase  virtues  virtue ethics is a philosophy developed by aristotle and other ancient greeks it is the quest to understand and live a life of the moral character  this characterbased approach to morality assumes that we acquire virtue through practice by practicing being honest brave just generous and so on a person develops an honorable and moral character according to aristotle by honing virtuous habits people will likely make the right choice when faced with ethical challenges  is there any thought model or practiceled package that defines the minimum constituents of what goes in not being an asshole so as to minimize the scope of subjectivity by aggregating collective constituents  \n",
