       "85475   hello everyone i feel into drama with my group of friends that i know for around years we know each other for around years we ride motorbikes together we went skiing together we went on trips together and things like that so we know each other for long time and have done many things together a few months ago we planned a short trip with my then new gf and couples from the same group of friends so i can introduce my gf to two other couples from the group the problem was that i had to cancel my trip because i feel ill and i couldnt go to the trip and because i canceled the trip my friend from the group friend a and his gf also canceled the trip this decision didnt go well with the friend b and his gf from the group and because of that friend b and his gf turned all other friends from the group against my friend a last weekend we all went the hole group for day trip and everyone ignored friend a and not wanted to talk to him except me friend a talked to friend b about this situation and b didnt want to discus or solve this issue so im noticing now that they started ignoring me to because i talked and hanged around my friend a and i really dont know what to do i couldnt ignore my friend a because he is still my friend and im not into this stupid drama i just want to hang around with my friends and ride motorbikes not acting like some high school teenagers we are all around years old but i also dont want to lose my other friends because its hard for me to find new friends did anything like that happened to you what would you do in my position i hope that my post is logical enough my english is not the best   \n",

       "      <td>okay so you need to find your height and weight google macro calculator and there should be an option at the end for if you want to maintain gain or lose weight the results will tell you how many calories protein carbs and fats you should aim to have in a day its very important that you dont go under no matter what and that you try to get as close as you can to the calories and protein numbers if you go to most websites for restaurants especially fast food they have the nutrition facts for all their food online so you can plan your means ahead of time i recommend subway for the most food for calories any cafeteria style place like subway or chipotle will have a bigger bang for your buck in terms of calories as opposed to a place like mcdonalds because the ingredients need to be fresh at cafeteria style places if you cant afford to eat out or only some days plan what to cook through a similar process get a food scale and learn how to weigh food and make like a weeks worth of meals all one one day so that all the food fits your macros when you are hungry you just eat the premade meals this isnt actually that hard but i would make at least but maybe different types of meals so you dont get board prepare for yourself if you know you like dessert try to plan a dessert into your plan if you like snacks plan for snacks more or less at this stage its calories in calories out meaning calories of skittles and calories of a salad are both calories to your body so you can have calories of skittles if you want now of skittles is significantly less than of salad so you wont be as full and satiated but you can judge for yourself download myfitnesspal to help track your food weigh yourself everyday now depending on how salty the food was how much water you drank etc some days it could look like you gained pounds overnight this is normal you probably just had salty food and your body is retaining water so its water weight as long as your weight is trending down you are on the right track dont fall off the course if or days you gain weight if you are gaining weight for longer adjust your meals and drink water with every meal one you save calories from not having soda or alcohol so you can use those calories on more food but also your stomach is a literal sack and so the more you fill that sack the less hungry you feel so filling with some water will keep you satiated longer</td>\n",

       "199116  im not a fan of restrictive diets i tried if and failed lol i try to do things that i can keep up with for years instead ive been researching this topic and here are some of my tips grocery shop on a full stomach so youre not tempted to buy junk food try not having junk food available at home reduce your sodium intake and drink a lot of water have a glass of warm lemon water in the morning it helps with digestion i hear green tea helps with digestion too increase your fruit and veggie intake fiber helps with digestion and it will help speed up your metabolism which will help you lose fat reduce your dairy intake what type of exercises do you do im not a morning person so i work out in the evening or afternoon in between my classes i do a mix of cardio and strength training cardio helps you burn calories faster but strength training helps you build muscle and ive read that the more muscle you have the harder it will be for you to gain fat you dont have to look like the hulk but a little bit of muscle helps strength training doesnt make me as tired as cardio does chloe ting has some great strength training videos on youtube if youre still hungry eat something healthy instead of staying hungry ive done an experiment on myself before where i noticed that when i was on a calorie restricted diet of foods like dairy and meat and some junk food and when i was on high carb plant based diet with less junk food and more fruits veggies where i would eat a lot more food i ate almost all the time lol i lost weight on the second diet faster even though i was eating less in the first one i didnt change my exercise routine either i didnt count my calories in the second diet though and i know that plant based foods of the same volume as nonplant based foods tend to be lower in calories so that could be one reason but i loved being able to eat large portions and eat whenever i wanted to without worrying about gaining weight as compared to the first diet where i was hungry all the time some other people have done the same and had similar results so you dont have to restrict yourself just choose healthier options you dont have to go completely plant based either try not to skip meals if your body isnt getting enough calories it will go into starvation mode where it will be storing more fat and make it harder to lose fat which also slows down your metabolism i read that getting some sunlight helps you lose fat too   \n",

       "350897                                       okay so you need to find your height and weight google macro calculator and there should be an option at the end for if you want to maintain gain or lose weight the results will tell you how many calories protein carbs and fats you should aim to have in a day its very important that you dont go under no matter what and that you try to get as close as you can to the calories and protein numbers if you go to most websites for restaurants especially fast food they have the nutrition facts for all their food online so you can plan your means ahead of time i recommend subway for the most food for calories any cafeteria style place like subway or chipotle will have a bigger bang for your buck in terms of calories as opposed to a place like mcdonalds because the ingredients need to be fresh at cafeteria style places if you cant afford to eat out or only some days plan what to cook through a similar process get a food scale and learn how to weigh food and make like a weeks worth of meals all one one day so that all the food fits your macros when you are hungry you just eat the premade meals this isnt actually that hard but i would make at least but maybe different types of meals so you dont get board prepare for yourself if you know you like dessert try to plan a dessert into your plan if you like snacks plan for snacks more or less at this stage its calories in calories out meaning calories of skittles and calories of a salad are both calories to your body so you can have calories of skittles if you want now of skittles is significantly less than of salad so you wont be as full and satiated but you can judge for yourself download myfitnesspal to help track your food weigh yourself everyday now depending on how salty the food was how much water you drank etc some days it could look like you gained pounds overnight this is normal you probably just had salty food and your body is retaining water so its water weight as long as your weight is trending down you are on the right track dont fall off the course if or days you gain weight if you are gaining weight for longer adjust your meals and drink water with every meal one you save calories from not having soda or alcohol so you can use those calories on more food but also your stomach is a literal sack and so the more you fill that sack the less hungry you feel so filling with some water will keep you satiated longer   \n",

       "      <td>ive had a cold shower every morning for the last or years i tried cold turkey cold shower no warm water for the first few months but its uncomfortable and hard to keep up in my opinion now i have a warm shower and then a cold shower after you can make it more gradual or more intense depending on your preference the reason i do both warm and cold is because both have their own nice set or benefits bonus if youre a guy its good for your swimmers to keep your sac colder rather than warmer during the day and a cold shower helps with it if you direct the stream a bit on your pair haha</td>\n",

       "      <td>cold showers wakes you up and makes you efficient no chance for thinking pretty much warm showers wakes you up to an extent not as much as cold showers but thats remedied because of my other daily routines not as efficient for me because i always forget to do shit so like half the time im just sitting in the shower warm showers really let you reflect but if you have really bad anxiety cold showers dont give you time for either positive or negative thinking so yeah go for that one</td>\n",

       "      <td>i had this problem too and what i was doing wrong is that once the book was finished i didnt do anything with it i felt great while reading the book but then i was just done and start reading another book this approach didnt worked i think its really important that you start stuying the materials in the book instead of just reading and forgeting about it in two weeks like i did first you need to identify what are the books worth studying then you need to inmerse yourself in the materials of the book read it and re read it highlight the important things notes summaries keep a journal on how you are applying the materials in the real world and the outcomes you are recieving and apply any other strategy you think is going to help you learn that doesnt mean you should just read one book your entire life you can keep reading but when you find those special treasures in form of books or ideas its important to get the most out of them</td>\n",

       "29332   how to review a book when i review a book i take care of a lot of things in the beginning when i started reviewing books the only thing which i considered was whether i liked it or not but over the time i understood that reviewing a book is a multi faceted activity where i need to look many aspects of a book following are some of them which i give importance to while reviewing rating a book how the book looks the physical appearance of a newly released book matters a lot is the font of the book good for me how many lines per page the book has depending on the genre of the book i may or may not buy it a poor paper quality can put me off unless the price of the book has been drastically cut and the book is relatively small under pages if the book is an old classic then the cover doesnt matter the cover page tells me a lot of things about it if i have not heard about a particular book and i see it in a book store for first time then the only thing attracts me towards a book is first its cover second its title the cover of a book can be simple or complicated but it should be soothing to eyes and it should match the genre of the book introduction part of the book i always try to scan through the introduction part of a book and try to understand the process the author has gone through while writing the book i also go through all the recommendations that some people might have given about the book and check if i have ever read any book recommended by them if i have not liked the book recommended by them in the past i become more careful and i think more about purchasing that book and try to look for some more information about the content of the book table of contents section of the book this part of the book gives me ample idea about the structure of a book i have seen many books where i get the feeling that the books main theme as per the title of the book would have ended in parts but one more part was added just for the sake of it i have seen this mainly in self help books actual content of the book if i have gone through the first three steps and the book looks promisingto me i purchase it and start reading at some point of time i try to see how the read is is it pacy slow or both if the book is non fiction does it have enough info graphics to explain the topics how is the language of the author is the author repeating the same thought multiple times i try to get into the mind of the author and try to see the content from his perspective i make note of anything important that i find in the book it can be any nice quote or a very good sentence which i have never heard anything good that i can find in the book i try to note it down somewhere and use it while i am writing the review the book writing the review of a book now the most important part of the book i start with giving credit to anyone who facilitated the book review and with a thanks note then i try to give summary of the book in two sentences and then i elaborate it with my own understanding of the book the important task in reviewing the book is how much of it you can keep remembered after you finish it this is mostly required for non fiction books to keep this under control i generally try to summarize each chapter after i finish remember its not verbatim its my own word that show my own understanding of the chapter but be careful it should not be too big if you find this overwhelming then start to summarize each page or paragraph and then build this habit from there step by step this way a time will come when you can easily summarize a chapter or multiple chapters but generally i restrict myself summarize each chapter that i finish then a time will come where you can hold the summary of chapter in your mind all you have to do it repeat all the chapters every time you move to a new chapter of the book its not easy but you will get it over the time not about review some times i would give a brief summary of the book and most of the time i talk about some part of it authors style of writing how the book ended or started was the book slow in the middle was the author able to explain the concepts well is the author using simple words or using heavy words like salman rushdie i never completed any book of salman rushdie because of difficult words that he uses do the characters in the book fit in well and so on after i while the review becomes my own and i can write anything that i feel about the book and no body can stop me from doing that above all develop your own style of reviewing a book and most important read your review twice may be once before you publish   \n",
